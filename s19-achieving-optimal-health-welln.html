        <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s00_p01">A groundbreaking study revealed the risk factors that can affect heart health.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s00_p02">The terms <em class="emphasis">risk factor</em>, <em class="emphasis">good cholesterol</em>, and <em class="emphasis">bad cholesterol</em> were not always on the tip of everyone’s tongue when it came to cardiovascular disease. In fact, at one time doctors didn’t even consider the concept of managing cholesterol levels to prevent heart disease. However, that was more than fifty years ago, before the Framingham Heart Study became one of the most important epidemiological studies in American health history. Conducted by what is now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Massachusetts, the study changed the way healthcare professionals and consumers alike regard the prevention of heart disease.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_001">Framingham Heart Study. “History of the Framingham Heart Study.” © 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/about/history.html">http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/about/history.html</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s00_p03">In the 1940s, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke. Most doctors thought a hardening of the arteries was a natural part of aging, and that rising blood pressure with age was not a serious issue. Yet, the death rates for cardiovascular disease had been increasing steadily since the early 1900s and had become an American epidemic. Growing concern led the US Public Health Service to commission a study to determine which biologic and environmental factors were behind the growing problem. The objective was to follow the development of cadiovascular disease over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms. Researchers believed this approach would enable them to identify common characteristics and factors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s00_p04">In 1948, researchers enrolled more than five thousand participants between ages thirty and sixty-two from Framingham, Massachusetts. The participants returned to the study every two years for a detailed medical examination and laboratory tests. In 1971, the Framingham Heart Study enrolled a second generation—the original participants’ adult children and their spouses. In 2002, a third generation—the grandchildren of the original group—joined the study. Recognizing the need to establish a new study reflecting a more diverse population, an additional group of participants was selected in 1994.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_002">Framingham Heart Study. “History of the Framingham Heart Study.” © 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/about/history.html">http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/about/history.html</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s00_p05">The findings of these extensive, long-term studies have created a treasure trove of data for scientists that has revolutionized the way our nation looks at heart disease. The results revealed high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol in particular, as risk factors for heart disease. The study also identified lifestyle choices as factors which increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, including eating an unhealthy diet, remaining sedentary, and smoking. By utilizing new diagnostic technologies, the Framingham Study continues to make important strides in learning about heart disease. Framingham investigators also collaborate with leading researchers from around the world on projects related to osteoporosis, arthritis, and diabetes. In addition, they have initiated the Framingham Nutrition Studies, which examine the connection between diet and nutrition to the risk and outcomes of cardiovascular disease. The discoveries of Framingham researchers can help discern opportunities for preventive nutrition intervention.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_003">Framingham Heart Study. “History of the Framingham Heart Study.” © 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/about/history.html">http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/about/history.html</a>.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s00_p07">How will you benefit from the knowledge about nutrition that you have gained thus far? The link between good nutrition and good health is an undebatable scientific fact. Given the consequences of poor dietary choices and lifestyle habits, it is worthwhile to assess your current food and activity profile to determine areas for improvement. It is important to remember that there are no quick fixes, but with dedication, hard work, and persistence, much can be accomplished. Of course, giving up what we once found enjoyable may not be the easiest task. In fact, it can be very hard to develop new thinking patterns that will translate into better dietary and lifestyle choices. Are you willing to put forth the effort necessary to create change in your life? As you read this chapter, you will be presented with tools and concepts to help you with this task. After that, it will be up to you.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Dietary Food Trends</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p01">Hundreds of years ago, when food was less accessible and daily life required much more physical activity, people worried less about obesity and more about simply getting enough to eat. In today’s industrialized nations, conveniences have solved some problems and introduced new ones, including the hand-in-hand obesity and diabetes epidemics. Fad diets gained popularity as more North Americans struggled with excess pounds. However, new evidence-based approaches that emphasize more holistic measures are on the rise. These new dietary trends encourage those seeking to lose weight to eat healthy, whole foods first, while adopting a more active lifestyle. These sound practices put dietary choices in the context of wellness and a healthier approach to life.</p>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Functional Foods</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s01_p01">Many people seek out foods that provide the greatest health benefits. This trend is giving rise to the idea of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">functional foods</a><span class="glossdef">Foods which do more than meet basic nutritional needs and could provide additional health benefits.</span></span>, which not only help meet basic nutritional needs but also are reported to fight illness and aging. According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), formerly known as the The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, functional foods may reduce the risk of disease or promote optimal health. The AND recognizes four types of functional foods.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_005">The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Functional Foods.” <em class="emphasis">J Am Diet Assoc</em> 109, no. 4 (April 2009): 735–46. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.eatright.org/About/Content.aspx?id=8354">http://www.eatright.org/About/Content.aspx?id=8354</a>.</span> They are: conventional foods, modified foods, medical foods, and special dietary use foods.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s01_p02">The first group, <strong class="emphasis bold">conventional foods</strong>, represents the simplest form of functional foods. They are whole foods that have not been modified. Examples include whole fruits and vegetables (which are abundant in phytochemicals and antioxidants), yogurt and kefir (which contain natural probiotic bacteria that can help maintain digestive system health), and dark chocolate (which contains antioxidants).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Modified foods</strong> have been fortified, enriched, or enhanced with additional nutrients or bioactive compounds. Foods are modified using biotechnology to improve their nutritional value and health attributes. Examples of modified foods include calcium-fortified orange juice, breads enriched with B vitamins, iodized salt, cereals fortified with vitamins and minerals, margarine enhanced with plant sterols, and energy drinks that have been enriched with herbs (ginseng or guarana) or amino acids (taurine). It is important to consider that the health claims of some modified foods may be debatable, or entirely fraudulent. Check with a health professional regarding the effects of modified foods on your health.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Medical foods</strong> are designed for enteric administration under the guidance of a medical professional. (During enteric administration, food is treated so that it goes through the stomach undigested. Instead, the food is broken down in the intestines only.) Medical foods are created to meet very specific nutritional requirements. Examples of medical foods include liquid formulas for people with kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes, or other health issues. Medical food is also given to comatose patients through a gastronomy tube because they cannot eat by mouth.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Special dietary use foods</strong> do not have to be administered under a doctor’s care and can be found in a variety of stores. Similar to medical foods, they address special dietary needs and meet the nutritional requirements of certain health conditions. For example, a bottled oral supplement administered under medical supervision is a medical food, but it becomes a special dietary use food when it is sold to retail customers. Examples of special dietary use foods include gluten-free foods, lactose-free dairy products, and formulas and shakes that promote weight loss.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_p01">The concept of functional foods represents initiatives aimed at addressing health problems. Certain diet plans take this concept one step further, by striving to prevent or treat specific conditions. For example, it is widely understood that people with diabetes need to follow a particular diet. Although some of these diet plans may be nutritionally sound, use caution because some diets may be fads or be so extreme that they actually <em class="emphasis">cause</em> health problems.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_006">Web MD. “Alternative Diet Programs: Topic Overview.” Last modified June 30, 2009. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/tc/alternative-diet-programs-topic-overview">http://www.webmd.com/diet/tc/alternative-diet-programs-topic-overview</a>.</span> Before experimenting with a diet, discuss your plans with your doctor or a registered dietitian.

The DASH diet is an evidence-based eating plan that can help reduce high blood pressure.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s01_p02">DASH dieters eat lots of whole grains and high-fiber fruits and vegetables, and moderate amounts of low-fat dairy products, lean meats, and heart-healthy fish. In addition, DASH limits the use of saturated fats to less than 7 percent of total calories, and restricts the consumption of sweets and alcohol. The DASH diet also calls for consuming less added sugar and drinking fewer sugar-sweetened drinks. It replaces red meat with fish and legumes and calls for increased calcium, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. Also, even though some people on the DASH diet may find it lowers their HDL (good) cholesterol along with their LDL (bad) cholesterol, it still has a positive cumulative effect on heart health.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_008">DASH Diet Oregon. “DASH Diet Eating Plan.” © 2011 Nutrition Education Services/Oregon Dairy Council. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.dashdietoregon.org/">http://www.dashdietoregon.org/</a>.</span></p>

One of the most important ways to treat this condition is to avoid the problematic foods, which is not easy. Although following a gluten-free diet is challenging, it is prescribed for patients with gluten intolerance and celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder with a genetic link. People who have celiac disease cannot consume gluten products without damaging their intestinal lining. Eating a gluten-free diet means finding replacements for bread, cereal, pasta, and more. It also means emphasizing fresh fruits, vegetables, and other foods without gluten. However, it is important to note that the gluten-free trend has become something of a fad even for those without a gluten intolerance. Celiac disease is a relatively rare condition found in only 1 percent of the population. Therefore, a gluten-free diet should be followed only with a physician’s recommendation.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Low-Carb Diets</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s03_p01">Low-carb diets, which include the Atkins Diet and the South Beach Diet, focus on limiting carbohydrates—such as grains, fruit, and starchy vegetables—to promote weight loss. The theory behind the low-carb diet is that insulin prevents the breakdown of fat by allowing sugar in the form of blood glucose to be used for energy. Proponents of this approach believe that because limiting carbs generally lowers insulin levels, it would then cause the body to burn stored fat instead. They believe this method not only brings about weight loss, but also reduces the risk factors for a number of conditions. However, some studies have shown that people who followed certain low-carb diet plans for two years lost an average of nearly 9 pounds, which is similar to the amount of weight lost on higher carbohydrate diets.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_009">The Mayo Clinic. “Low-Carb Diet: Can It Help You Lose Weight?” Accessed December 21, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/low-carb-diet/NU00279">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/low-carb-diet/NU00279</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s03_p02">The benefits of this kind of diet include an emphasis on whole, unprocessed foods and a de-emphasis of refined carbohydrates, such as white flour, white bread, and white sugar. However, there are a number of downsides. Typically, the first two weeks allow for only 20 grams of carbs per day, which can be dangerously low. In addition, dieters using the low-carb approach tend to consume twice as many saturated fats as people on a diet high in healthy carbohydrates. Low-carb diets are also associated with a higher energy intake, and the notion that “calories don’t count,” which is prevalent in this kind of diet, is not supported by scientific evidence.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_010">Steele, V. “Health and Nutritional Effects of Popular Diets.” Kellogg Nutrition Symposium, The Team of Registered Dietitians &amp; Nutrition Professionals at Kellogg Canada Inc.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s04_p01">The macrobiotic diet is part of a health and wellness regimen based in Eastern philosophy. It combines certain tenets of Zen Buddhism with a vegetarian diet and supports a balance of the oppositional forces <em class="emphasis">yin</em> and <em class="emphasis">yang</em>. Foods are paired based on their so-called yin or yang characteristics. Yin foods are thought to be sweet, cold, and passive, while yang foods are considered to be salty, hot, and aggressive.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s04_p02">Whole grains make up about 50 percent of the calories consumed and are believed to have the best balance of yin and yang. Raw and cooked vegetables comprise about 30 percent of the diet and include kale, cabbage, collards, bok choy, and broccoli on a daily basis, along with mushrooms and celery a few times a week. Bean or vegetable-based soups and broths can make up 5 to 10 percent of daily caloric intake. Additionally, the diet allows small amounts of fish and seafood several times a week, along with a few servings of nuts. The macrobiotic diet prohibits certain foods, such as chocolate, tropical fruits, and animal products, because they are believed to fall on the far end of the yin-yang spectrum, which would make it difficult to achieve a Zen-like balance.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s04_p03">The macrobiotic diet focuses on foods that are low in saturated fats and high in fiber, which can help to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. Proponents of this diet also believe that it may protect against cancer. However, many nutritionists and healthcare providers express concerns, particularly if the diet is followed strictly. Extreme macrobiotic eating can be low in protein, low in calories, and pose a risk for starvation. In addition, the diet is also very low in essential vitamins and minerals.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_011">Zelman, K.M. “Macrobiotic Diet.” Web MD.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s05_p01">The traditional Mediterranean diet incorporates many elements of the dietary choices of people living in Greece and southern Italy. The Mediterranean diet focuses on small portions of nutritionally-sound food. This diet features food from plant sources, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, breads and potatoes, and olive oil. It also restricts the consumption of processed foods and recommends eating locally grown foods rich in micronutrients and antioxidants. Other aspects of this eating plan include consuming fish and poultry at least twice per week, eating red meat only a few times per month, having up to seven eggs per week, and drinking red wine in moderation and with meals. Unlike most diets, the Mediterranean diet does not cut fat consumption across the board. Instead, it incorporates low-fat cheese and dairy products, and it substitutes olive oil, canola oil, and other healthy oils for butter and margarine.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s05_p02">More than fifty years of nutritional and epidemiological research has shown that people who follow the Mediterranean diet have some of the lowest rates of chronic disease and the highest rates of longevity among the populations of the world.

Participants who described greater consumption of extra-virgin olive oil reportedly lowered their risk of suffering a stroke by 41 percent. The study controlled for stroke risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol intake, high blood pressure, and a sedentary lifestyle. To increase the amount of olive oil in your diet, try spreading olive oil instead of butter on your toast, making your own salad dressing using olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, and herbs, cooking with olive oil exclusively, or simply adding a dose of it to your favorite meal.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_013">Holohan, E. “More Olive Oil in Diet Could Cut Stroke Risk: Study.” HealthFinder.gov, US Department of Health and Human Services. © 2011 Health Day. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://healthfinder.gov/news/newsstory.aspx?docID=653917">http://healthfinder.gov/news/newsstory.aspx?docID=653917</a>.</span></p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">The Raw Food Diet</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s06_p01">The raw food diet is followed by those who avoid cooking as much as possible in order to take advantage of the full nutrient content of foods. The principle behind <strong class="emphasis bold">raw foodism</strong> is that plant foods in their natural state are the most wholesome for the body. The raw food diet is not a weight-loss plan, it is a lifestyle choice. People who practice raw foodism eat only uncooked and nonprocessed foods, emphasizing whole fruits and vegetables. Staples of the raw food diet include whole grains, beans, dried fruits, seeds and nuts, seaweed, sprouts, and unprocessed produce. As a result, food preparation mostly involves peeling, chopping, blending, straining, and dehydrating fruits and vegetables.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s06_p02">The positive aspects of this eating method include consuming foods that are high in fiber and nutrients, and low in calories and saturated fat. However, the raw food diet offers little in the way of protein, dairy, or fats, which can cause deficiencies of the vitamins A, D, E, and K. In addition, not all foods are healthier uncooked, such as spinach and tomatoes. Also, cooking eliminates potentially harmful microorganisms that can cause foodborne illnesses. Therefore, people who primarily eat raw foods should thoroughly clean all fruit and vegetables before eating them. Poultry and other meats should <em class="emphasis">always</em> be cooked before eating.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_014">Web MD. “Raw Food Diet.” Accessed December 21, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/guide/raw-food-diet">http://www.webmd.com/diet/guide/raw-food-diet</a>.</span></p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Vegetarian and Vegan Diets</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s07_p01">Vegetarian and vegan diets have been followed for thousands of years for different reasons, including as part of a spiritual practice, to show respect for living things, for health reasons, or because of environmental concerns. For many people, being a vegetarian is a logical outgrowth of “thinking green.” When a food system is heavily focused on meat production there are deforestation issues, overgrazing of land and pasturage, and animal abuses. By avoiding animal flesh, vegetarians hope to look after their own health and that of the planet at the same time. Broadly speaking, vegetarians eat beans, grains, and fruits and vegetables, and do not eat red meat, poultry, seafood, or any other animal flesh. Some vegetarians, known as lactovegetarians, will eat dairy products. Others, known as lacto-ovo vegetarians, will eat dairy products and eggs. A vegan diet is the most restrictive vegetarian diet—vegans do not eat dairy, eggs, or other animal products, and some do not eat honey.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s07_p02">Vegetarian diets have a number of benefits. Well-balanced eating plans can lower the risk of a number of chronic conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. They also help to promote sustainable agriculture. However, if a vegetarian does not vary his or her food choices, the diet may be insufficient in calcium, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and vitamin B<sub class="subscript">12</sub>. Also, if people who follow these diets do not plan out their meals, they may gravitate toward foods high in fats.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p01">Current trends also include the use of supplementation to promote health and wellness. Vitamins, minerals, herbal remedies, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">supplements</a><span class="glossdef">Vitamins, minerals, and herbs which are taken in addition to your regular diet to promote healthy body functions or to target specific body parts.</span></span> of all kinds constitute big business and many of their advertising claims suggest that optimal health and eternal youth are just a pill away. The main types of dietary supplements are macronutrients (amino acids, proteins, essential fatty acids), micronutrients (vitamins and minerals that promote healthy body functions), probiotics (beneficial bacteria such as the kind found in the intestines), and herbal supplements, which often target a specific body part, such as bones.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p02">Some public health officials recommend a daily multivitamin due to the poor diet of most North Americans.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p03">However, before you begin using dietary supplementation, consider that the word <em class="emphasis">supplement</em> denotes something added. Vitamins, minerals, and other assorted remedies should be considered as extras. They are add-ons—not replacements—for a healthy diet. As food naturally contains nutrients in its proper package, remember that food should always be your primary source of nutrients. When considering taking supplements, it is important to recognize possible drawbacks that are specific to each kind:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Micronutrient Supplements.</strong> Some vitamins and minerals are toxic at high doses. Therefore, it is vital to adhere to the Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL) so as not to consume too much of any vitamin. For example, too much vitamin A is toxic to the liver. Symptoms of vitamin A toxicity can include tinnitus (ringing in the ears), blurred vision, hair loss, and skin rash. Too much niacin can cause a peptic ulcer, hyperglycemia, dizziness, and gout.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Herbal Supplements.</strong> Some herbs cause side effects, such as heart palpitations and high blood pressure, and must be taken very carefully. Also, some herbs have contraindications with certain medicines. For example, Valerian and St. John’s Wort negatively interact with certain prescription medications, most notably antidepressants. Additionally, there is a real risk of overdosing on herbs because they do not come with warning labels or package inserts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Amino Acid Supplements.</strong> Certain amino acid supplements, which are taken by bodybuilders among others, can increase the risk of consuming too much protein. An occasional amino acid drink in the place of a meal is not a problem. However, problems may arise if you add the supplement to your existing diet. Most Americans receive two to three times the amount of protein required on a daily basis from their existing diets—taking amino acid supplements just adds to the excess.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_016">Web MD. “Choosing a Vitamin and Mineral Supplement—Topic Overview.” Last revised May 4, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/tc/choosing-a-vitamin-and-mineral-supplement-topic-overview">http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/tc/choosing-a-vitamin -and-mineral-supplement-topic-overview</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_p07">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates supplements, but it treats them like food rather than pharmaceuticals. Dietary supplements must meet the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Standards, but are not required to meet the standards for drugs, although some companies do so voluntarily. Also, although supplement manufacturers are allowed to say a particular ingredient may reduce the risk of a disease or disorder, or that it might specifically target certain body systems, these claims are not approved by the FDA. This is why labels that make structural and functional claims are required to carry a disclaimer saying the product is not intended “to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” In addition, in the United States, supplements are taken off the market only after the FDA has proven that they are hazardous.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_017">Watson, S. “How to Evaluate Vitamins and Supplements.” Web MD.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Before Taking Supplements</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_s01_p01">The phrase <em class="emphasis">caveat emptor</em> means “buyer beware,” and it is important to keep the term in mind when considering supplementation. Just because a product is “natural” that does not mean it can’t be harmful or dangerous, particularly if used inappropriately. The following are helpful questions to explore before deciding to take a supplement:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>Does the scientific community understand how this supplement works and are all its effects well known?</li>
                <li>Is there proof that the supplement actually performs in the manner that it claims?</li>
                <li>Does this supplement interact with food or medication?</li>
                <li>Is taking this supplement necessary for my health?</li>
                <li>Is the supplement affordable?</li>
                <li>Is the supplement safe and free from contaminants?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s01_s02_s01_p02">Lastly, please remember that a supplement is only as good as the diet that accompanies it. We cannot overstate the importance of eating a healthy, well-balanced diet designed to provide all of the necessary nutrients. Food contains many more beneficial substances, such as phytochemicals and fiber, that promote good health and cannot be duplicated with a pill or a regimen of supplements. Therefore, vitamins and other dietary supplements should never be a substitute for food. Nutrients should always be derived from food first.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_p01">Becoming physically fit is an important part of achieving optimal health. A well-rounded exercise program is crucial to become and remain healthy. Physical activity improves your health in a number of ways. It promotes weight loss, strengthens muscles and bones, keeps the heart and lungs strong, and helps to protect against chronic disease. There are four essential elements of physical fitness: cardiorespiratory endurance, muscle strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility. Some enthusiasts might argue the relative importance of each, but optimal health requires some degree of balance between all four. Neither a muscle-bound weight lifter unable to bend down to tie his shoes nor a flexible yoga enthusiast who cannot lift her suitcase can be considered completely fit. All four elements of physical fitness are vital.</p>

Working on this element of physical fitness also improves your circulatory system. It boosts your ability to supply the body’s cells with oxygen and nutrients, and to remove carbon dioxide and metabolic waste. In addition, aerobic exercise makes you breathe faster and more deeply, which maximizes oxygen levels in the blood. Regular, moderate aerobic activity, about thirty minutes at a time for five days per week, trains the body to deliver oxygen more efficiently, which strengthens the heart and lungs, and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_018">Mayo Clinic. “Fitness Training: Elements of a Well-Rounded Routine.” September 3, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fitness-training/HQ01305">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fitness-training/HQ01305</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s01_p02">The most common standard for evaluating cardiorespiratory endurance is the <strong class="emphasis bold">VO</strong><sub class="subscript">2</sub> <strong class="emphasis bold">max</strong> test. VO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> max is your maximal oxygen uptake, and the VO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> max test measures the amount of oxygen (in relation to body weight) that you can use per minute. A test subject usually walks or runs on a treadmill with an air mask over their face to measure oxygen consumption as exercise intensity increases (see <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s01_n01">Note 15.14 "Video 15.2"</a>). At some point, the amount of oxygen consumed no longer increases despite an increase in exercise intensity. This value of oxygen consumption is referred to as VO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> max, ‘V’ meaning volume, and ‘max’ meaning the maximum amount of oxygen (O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) consumed independent of exercise intensity. The higher the number, the more oxygen you can consume, and the faster or longer you can walk, run, bike, or swim, among other aerobic activities.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_019">Ed Eyestone, “How to Improve Your VO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> Max,” <em class="emphasis">Runner’s World</em>, 9 January 2008. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-244--12408-0,00.html">http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-244--12408-0,00.html</a>.</span></p>

They are not just crucial for athletes and bodybuilders—building muscle strength and endurance is important for children, seniors, and everyone in between. The support that your muscles provide allows you to work, play, and live more efficiently. Strength training involves the use of resistance machines, resistance bands, free weights, or other tools. However, you do not need to pay for a gym membership or expensive equipment to strengthen your muscles. Homemade weights, such as plastic bottles filled with sand, can work just as well. You can also use your own body weight and do push-ups, leg squats, abdominal crunches, and other exercises to build your muscles. If strength training is performed at least twice a week, it can help to improve muscle strength and endurance, and to increase bone strength. Strength training can also help you to maintain muscle mass during a weight-loss program.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_020">Mayo Clinic. “Fitness Training: Elements of a Well-Rounded Routine.” September 3, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fitness-training/HQ01305">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fitness-training/HQ01305</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s01_p05">Some forms of exercise confer multiple benefits, which can help you to balance the different elements of physical fitness. For example, riding a bicycle for thirty minutes or more not only builds cardiorespiratory endurance, it also improves muscle strength and muscle endurance. Some forms of yoga can also build muscle strength and endurance, along with flexibility.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Metabolic Fitness</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s02_p01">Being fit also encompasses <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">metabolic fitness</a><span class="glossdef">Ability to provide energy to the muscles during physical activity.</span></span>. It relates to the number of calories you require to survive and the number of calories you burn during physical activity. Recall from <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch11#zimmerman_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Energy Balance and Body Weight"</a> that <strong class="emphasis bold">metabolism</strong> is the sum of all chemical reactions that occur in the human body to conduct life’s processes. Some are catabolic reactions that break down nutrients to supply the body with cellular energy. The rate at which a person burns calories depends on body shape, body composition, sex, age, nutritional status, and genetics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s02_p02">One measurement of metabolic fitness is <strong class="emphasis bold">resting metabolic rate</strong>, or RMR, which is a measurement of the amount of energy required for the body to maintain its basic functions while at rest, i.e. breathing, heart beats, liver and kidney function, and so on. On average, RMR accounts for between 50 and 70 percent of a person’s total daily energy expenditure. Different factors can affect the RMR, and as a result it is not a perfect measurement for metabolic fitness. For example, a slender person who is tall has more body surface area and therefore has a higher RMR. Also, muscle utilizes more energy at rest than fat, and a person with more muscle mass has a higher RMR.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_022">Moninger, J. “Metabolism Hacks: Tap into Your Calorie-Burning Power.” Web MD. Accessed December 21, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/metabolism-hacks">http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/metabolism-hacks</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s02_p03">A second measurement of metabolic fitness is the number of calories burned during physical activity. The amount of calories burned depends on the rate at which the heart beats, how much oxygen is delivered to tissues, and how efficiently metabolic reactions consume oxygen and burn calories. One of the best estimates of energy expenditure during exercise is how much oxygen a person consumes. Recall that VO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> max is used to measure cardiorespiratory endurance. Greater VO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> max is indicative of better oxygen metabolism and cardiovascular fitness, meaning more calories burned. In contrast to RMR, VO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> max increases significantly with exercise training, from increasing blood flow to tissues to increasing the strength of heart muscle contraction. Greater blood flow into the tissues means more oxygen to muscle, which means more calories burned.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s02_p04">Increasing your daily activity and shedding excess weight helps to improve metabolic fitness. However, you do not have to be the perfect weight to be metabolically fit. Metabolic fitness is highly individualized. Also, any improvement to metabolic fitness is beneficial and means a decrease in the risk for developing diabetes, or other chronic conditions.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s03_p01">Regular physical activity is one of the best things you can do to achieve optimal health. Individuals who are physically active for about seven hours per week lower the risk of dying early by 40 percent compared to those who are active for less than thirty minutes per week.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_023">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Physical Activity and Health: The Benefits of Physical Activity.” Last updated February 16, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/health/index.html">http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/health/index.html</a>.</span> Improving your overall fitness involves sticking with an exercise program on a regular basis. If you are nervous or unsure about becoming more active, the good news is that moderate-intensity activity, such as brisk walking, is safe for most people. Also, the health advantages of becoming active far outweigh the risks. Physical activity not only helps to maintain your weight, it also provides a wealth of benefits—physical, mental, and emotional.</p>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Physical Benefits</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s03_s01_p01">Getting the recommended amount of physical activity each week, about 150 minutes of moderate, aerobic exercise, such as power walking or bicycling, does not require joining a gym, wearing spandex, or taking expensive, complicated classes. If you can’t commit to a formal workout four to five days per week, you can become more active in simple ways—by taking the stairs instead of the elevator, by walking more instead of driving, by going out dancing with your friends, or by doing your household chores at a faster pace. It is not necessary to perform at the level of a professional dancer or athlete, or to work out for several hours every day, to see real gains from exercise. Even slightly increased activity can lead to physical benefits, such as:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s03_s02_p01">The benefits of an exercise program are not just physical, they are mental and emotional as well. Anyone who has gone for a walk to clear their head knows the mental benefits of exercise firsthand. Also, you do not have to be a marathoner on a “runner’s high” to enjoy the emotional benefits of becoming active. The mental and emotional benefits of physical activity include:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s03_s03_p01">A physically active lifestyle yields so many health benefits that it is recommended for everyone. Change is not always easy, but even small changes such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or parking farther away from a store to add a bit more walking into your day can lead to a more active lifestyle and set you on the road to optimal health. When people go one step further by walking or biking on a regular basis, or becoming active by growing and maintaining a garden, they do more than promote their own health—they safeguard the health of the planet, too.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s03_s03_p02">As you change to a more active lifestyle, select an activity that you can integrate into your schedule smoothly, so you can maintain it. For example, instead of making time to get coffee with friends, you might suggest a walk, roller blading, or going for a swim in the campus pool. Also, find an activity that you will be motivated to do. Some people decide to participate in team sports, such as local soccer or softball leagues, because they enjoy being active with others or like knowing that a team relies on them. Others prefer to take a class, such as spinning or yoga, that is led by an instructor who will motivate them. Still others prefer more solitary pursuits, such as taking a jog alone in their neighborhood. No matter what your preference, you are more likely to stick to a workout program if you enjoy it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s02_s03_s03_p03">Whatever activities people choose to do, if they expend an extra 500 calories per day, they will lose 1 pound per week, become more physically fit, and maintain a healthy nutritional profile. The exact number of calories expended per hour will vary, depending on an individual’s weight and level of exertion. However, it can be helpful to keep these numbers in mind (which are for an adult who weighs about 160 pounds) when considering a program of aerobic activity:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p01">Chronic diseases are ongoing, life-threatening, and life-altering health challenges. They are the leading cause of death worldwide. Chronic conditions are increasing in frequency. They cause significant physical and emotional suffering and are an impediment to economic growth and vitality. It is important, now more than ever, to understand the different risk factors for chronic disease and to learn how to prevent their development.</p>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Risk Factors of Chronic Disease</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01_p01">A <strong class="emphasis bold">risk factor</strong> is a signal that your chances for acquiring a chronic disease may be increased. You might liken a risk factor to the flags that lifeguards sometimes set up at beaches. When you see these flags, you know immediately that swimming within the marked areas could be hazardous, and that if you choose to swim within these parameters anyway, you are doing so at your own risk. But, if you heed the warnings, you are taking the necessary step to protect your safety and health. Similarly, risk factors are warning signs that coincide with the development and progression of disease. However, risk factors are not a 100-percent guarantee that a person will develop a chronic disease, only that the conditions are right. For example, if a person gets sick with the flu, we can say with certainty that the illness was caused by a virus. However, we cannot say that a sedentary lifestyle caused the onset of cardiovascular disease in a patient, because a risk factor indicates a correlation, not a causation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01_p02">Chronic disease usually develops alongside a combination of the following risk factors: genetics, a prior disease such as obesity or hypertension, dietary and lifestyle choices, and environmental problems. Risk factors such as genetics and age cannot be changed. However, some risk factors can be altered to promote health and wellness (such as diet). For example, a person who continuously eats a diet high in sugars, saturated fats, and red meat is at risk for becoming obese and developing Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or several other conditions. Making more healthy dietary choices can greatly reduce that risk. Being a woman over age sixty-five is a risk factor for developing osteoporosis, but that cannot be changed. Also, people without a genetic predisposition for a particular chronic illness can still develop it. Not having a genetic predipostion for a chronic disease is not a guarantee of immunity.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Identifying Your Risk Factors</h3>
                <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01_p03">To estimate your own risk factors for developing certain chronic diseases, search through your family’s medical history. What diseases do you note showing up among close blood relatives? This may be of concern to you. At your next physical, pay attention to your blood tests and ask the doctor if any results are out of normal range. It is also helpful to note your vital signs, particularly your blood pressure and resting heart rate. In addition, you may wish to keep a food diary to make a note of the dietary choices that you make on a regular basis and be aware of foods that are high in saturated fat, among other unhealthy options. As a general rule, it is important to look for risk factors that you can modify.to promote your health. For example, if you discover that your grandmother, aunt, and uncle all suffered from high blood pressure, then you may decide to avoid a high sodium diet. Identifying your risk factors can arm you with the information you need to help ward off disease.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p01">Throughout the remainder of this section, we will examine some of the more prevalent chronic diseases, their risk factors, and the choices that can help to discourage their development or progression. Let’s begin with cardiovascular disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_025">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Leading Causes of Death.” Last updated September 6, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod..htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm</a>.</span> The disease generally starts with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">atherosclerosis</a><span class="glossdef">Disease that is characterized by the deposition of plaques and fatty material in the walls of the body’s artery, vein and blood vessel network.</span></span>, or a hardening of the arteries, a chronic condition so common that most people show signs of it by the time they turn thirty. Arteries start to narrow and harden when fats accumulate along their inner walls and form plaques. A plaque is made of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in blood.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p02">Plaque formation causes arteries to narrow and harden, which elevates blood pressure because the vessels can’t expand effectively to accommodate blood pulses. Higher blood pressure strains the heart and causes more damage. Arterial walls can become so weakened due to high blood pressure that they balloon and form what is known as an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aneurysm</a><span class="glossdef">Swelling or enlargement of the artery due to a weakening in the artery wall.</span></span>. If the aneurysm bursts, it becomes a life-threatening event. The plaques themselves can also rupture due to a spike in blood pressure or a tremor along an arterial wall, and the body responds to this perceived injury by forming blood clots. These clots are serious health threats, whether they are stationary (a thrombus) or moving (an embolus). A stable clot can slowly kill off surrounding tissue, or grow so big that it blocks blood circulation and causes <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thrombosis</a><span class="glossdef">Development of a blood clot inside of a blood vessel.</span></span>. When a moving clot becomes stuck in an artery too small for its passage, it cuts off blood flow and causes cell death. This is referred to as an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">embolism</a><span class="glossdef">Blood vessel obstruction caused by a mass, such as a detached blood clot or other foreign body, that circulates in the bloodstream.</span></span>. Blood clots in heart and brain arteries can cause heart attacks or strokes.</p>

It is helpful to lower sodium intake, increase consumption of dietary fiber, and limit consumption of saturated fat, which promotes plaque formation. In addition, it is important to replace refined starches and added sugar, which can boost triglycerides, with whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, especially fish, using alcohol in moderation, and opting for low or no-fat dairy products can all help reduce your cardiovascular disease risk. Emphasizing vegetable-based sources of protein, such as beans and legumes, can be beneficial, as well as consuming more soy products. It is also important to maintain a healthy weight, manage cholesterol levels, and avoid smoking or chewing tobacco.</p>

Cancer is triggered by mutations in a cell’s genetic material. The cause of these changes may be inherited, or it may result from exposure to carcinogens, which are agents that can cause cancer. Carcinogens include chemicals, viruses, certain medical treatments such as radiation, pollution, or other substances and exposures that are known or suspected to cause cancer.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_027">American Cancer Society. “Known and Probable Human Carcinogens.” Last medical review June 29, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/GeneralInformationaboutCarcinogens/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens">http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/GeneralInformationaboutCarcinogens/known-and-probable -human-carcinogens</a>.</span> The National Institutes of Health has classified fifty-four different compounds as known cancer-causing agents in humans.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_028">Brett Israel, “How Many Cancers Are Caused by the Environment?” <em class="emphasis">Scientific American</em>, 21 May 2010. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-many-cancers-are-caused-by-the-environment">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-many -cancers-are-caused-by-the-environment</a>.</span></p>

Cells become cancerous when their DNA is damaged, but they do not self-destruct or stop reproducing as normal cells would. As these abnormal cells continue their rapid growth, in most cancers they coalesce in a mass called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tumor</a><span class="glossdef">Abnormal mass of body tissue that results from uncontrolled and progressive cell growth.</span></span>. Cancer cells can overwhelm healthy cells and interfere with the healthy functioning of the body.

Scientists and the medical community are giving considerable attention to the early stages of cancer, from the moment a healthy cell is exposed to a carcinogen to the point where cells with damaged DNA are replicating out of control. Intervention at any of these early stages could prove to be quite beneficial, because it is thought that most cancers are the result of lifestyle choices and environmental exposure.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s05_s01_p01">Unfortunately, Type 1 diabetes is almost impossible to prevent, although some clinical research suggests that breastfeeding an infant for at least three months may decrease the child’s risk of developing this condition. However, people who are at risk for Type 2 or gestational diabetes can take steps to avoid the disease. For example, it is crucial to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight through regular physical activity. If you are at risk, strive for at least thirty minutes of moderate to intense exercise at least three times per week. Proper nutrition is also vital, and it is important to restrict sugary snacks, beverages, and desserts, and to limit the intake of trans fats and saturated fats. In addition, those who are at risk should consume whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, along with two servings of nonfried fish per week.</p>

Regular testing should begin at a younger age, and be performed frequently if you have any risk factors for developing Type 2 diabetes. In order to assess your health status, the following is recommended:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Foodborne illness</strong> is another serious threat to health. Sometimes called “food poisoning,” foodborne illness is a common public health problem that can result from exposure to a pathogen or a toxin via food or beverages. Raw foods, such as seafood, produce, and meats, can all be contaminated during harvest (or slaughter for meats), processing, packaging, or during distribution, though meat and poultry are the most common source of foodborne illness. For all kinds of food, contamination also can occur during preparation and cooking in a home kitchen or in a restaurant. In many developing nations, contaminated water is also a major source of foodborne illness.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_p02">Many people are affected by foodborne illness each year, making food safety a very important issue. Annually, one out of six Americans becomes sick after consuming contaminated foods or beverages.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_036">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Food Safety at CDC.” Last updated June 28, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/facts.html">http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/facts.html</a>.</span> Foodborne illness can range from mild stomach upset to severe symptoms, or even fatalities. The problem of food contamination can not only be dangerous to your health, it can also be harmful to your wallet. Medical costs and lost wages due to salmonellosis, just one foodborne disease, are estimated at over $1 billion per year.</p>

        <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_p03">No one is immune from consuming contaminated food. But, whether you become seriously ill depends on the microorganism, the amount you have consumed, and your overall health. In addition, some groups have a higher risk than others for developing severe complications to foodborne disease. Who is most at risk? Young children, elderly people, and pregnant women all have a higher chance of becoming very sick after consuming contaminated food. Other high-risk groups include people with compromised immune systems due to HIV/AIDS, immunosuppressive medications (such as after an organ transplant), and long-term steroid use for asthma or arthritis. Exposure to contaminated food could also pose problems for diabetics, cancer patients, people who have liver disease, and people who have stomach problems as a result of low stomach acid or previous stomach surgery. People in all of these groups should handle food carefully, make sure that what they eat has been cooked thoroughly, and avoid taking any chances that could lead to exposure.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Major Types of Foodborne Illness</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p01">Foodborne illnesses are either infectious or toxic in nature. The difference depends on the agent that causes the condition. Microbes, such as bacteria, cause food infections, while toxins, such as the kind produced by molds, cause intoxications. Different diseases manifest in different ways, so signs and symptoms can vary with the source of contamination. However the illness occurs, the microbe or toxin enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract, and as a result common symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, dehydration, lightheadedness, and rapid heartbeat. More severe complications can include a high fever, diarrhea that lasts more than three days, prolonged vomiting, bloody stools, and signs of shock.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p02">One of the biggest misconceptions about foodborne illness is that it is always triggered by the last meal that a person ate. However, it may take several days or more before the onset of symptoms. If you develop a foodborne illness, you should rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid antidiarrheal medications, because they could slow the elimination of the contaminant.</p>

The infection then grows inside the body and becomes the source of symptoms. Food infections can be sporadic and often are not reported to physicians. However, ocassional outbreaks occur that put communities, states and provinces, or even entire nations at risk. For example, in 1994, an outbreak of the infection salmonellosis occurred in the United States due to contaminated ice cream. An estimated 224,000 people became ill. In 1988, contaminated clams resulted in an outbreak of hepatitis A in China, which affected about 300,000 people.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_038">World Health Organization. “Food Safety and Foodborne Illness.” <em class="emphasis">Fact Sheet</em>, no. 237.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s02_p01">Both food infections and food intoxications can create a burden on health systems, when patients require treatment and support, and on food systems, when companies must recall contaminated food or address public concerns. It all begins with the agent that causes the contamination. When a person ingests a food contaminant, it travels to the stomach and intestines. There, it can interfere with the body’s functions and make you sick. In the next part, we will focus on different types of food contaminants and examine common microbes, toxins, chemicals, and other substances that can cause food infections and intoxications. Let’s begin with pathogens, which include bacteria and viruses. About one hundred years ago, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and cholera were common diseases caused by food and water contaminated by pathogens. Over time, improvements in food processing and water treatment eliminated most of those problems in North America. Today, other bacteria and viruses have become common causes of food infection.</p>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Bacteria</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s02_s01_p01">All foods naturally contain small amounts of bacteria. However, poor handling and preparation of food, along with improper cooking or storage can multiply bacteria and cause illness. In addition, bacteria can multiply quickly when cooked food is left out at room temperature for more than a few hours. Most bacteria grow undetected because they do not change the color or texture of food or produce a bad odor. Freezing and refrigeration slow or stop the growth of bacteria, but does not destroy the bacteria completely. The microbes can reactivate when the food is taken out and thawed.</p>

No one knows how many species of fungi exist, but estimates range from ten- to three-hundred thousand. Unlike single-celled bacteria, molds are multicellular, and under a microscope look like slender mushrooms. They have stalks with spores that form at the ends. The spores give molds their color and can be transported by air, water, or insects. Spores also enable mold to reproduce. Additionally, molds have root-like threads that may grow deep into food and be difficult to see. The threads are very deep when a food shows heavy mold growth. Foods that contain mold may also have bacteria growing alongside it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s02_s04_p02">Some molds, like the kind found in blue cheese, are desirable in foods, while other molds can be dangerous.

In the right conditions, a few molds produce <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mycotoxins</a><span class="glossdef">Natural, poisonous substance produced by certain molds and mushrooms that can cause foodborne illness.</span></span>, which are natural, poisonous substances that can make you sick if they are consumed. Mycotoxins are contained in and around mold threads, and in some cases, may have spread throughout the food. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that mycotoxins affect 25 percent of the world’s food crops. They are found primarily in grains and nuts, but other sources include apples, celery, and other produce.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s02_s04_p03">The most dangerous mycotoxins are <strong class="emphasis bold">aflatoxins</strong>, which are produced by strains of fungi called <em class="emphasis">Aspergillus</em> under certain temperature and humidity conditions.

They protect crops and ensure a large yield. However, synthetic pesticides can leave behind residues, particularly on produce, that can be harmful to human health. Foods that contain the highest levels of pesticide residue include conventionally-grown peaches, apples, bell peppers, celery, nectarines, strawberries, cherries, pears, spinach, lettuce, and potatoes. Foods that contain the lowest levels of pesticide residue include avocadoes, pineapples, bananas, mangoes, asparagus, cabbage, and broccoli.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_046">Hoffman, M.

However, harmful exposures can lead to certain health problems and complications, including cancer. Also, infants and young children are more susceptible to the hazards of pesticides than adults. In addition, using synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers contributes to soil and water pollution and can be hazardous to farm workers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s02_s06_p02">To protect the public and their workers, many farmers now rely on alternatives to synthetic pesticide use, including crop rotation, natural pesticides, and planting nonfood crops nearby to lure pests away. Some consumers choose to reduce their exposure to pesticides by purchasing organic produce. Organic foods are grown or produced without synthetic pesticides or fertilizer, and all growers and processors must be certified by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). However, conventionally-grown produce should be fine for fruits and vegetables that appear on the low-residue list.</p>

Chemical runoff from factories can pollute food products and drinking water. For example, <strong class="emphasis bold">dioxins</strong> are chemical compounds created in industrial processes, such as manufacturing and bleaching pulp and paper. Fish that swim in dioxin-polluted waters can contain significant amounts of this pollutant, which causes cancer. When metals contaminate food, it can result in serious and even life-threatening health problems. A common metal contaminant is lead, which can be present in drinking water, soil, and air. Lead exposure most often affects children, who can suffer from physical and mental developmental delays as a result.</p>

This highly toxic chemical can cause mercury poisoning, which leads to developmental problems in children, as well as autoimmune effects. A condition called Minamata disease was identified in 1956 in Japan. It was named for the town of Minamata, which was the site of an environmental disaster when methyl mercury was released into the surface water near a factory. Many residents experienced neurological issues, including numbness in hands and feet, muscle weakness, a narrowing of the field of vision, damage to hearing and speech, and ataxia, which is a lack of muscle coordination.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_047">Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan. “Minamata Disease: The History and Measures.” © 2002.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_p01">Most foodborne infections go unreported and undiagnosed. However, the CDC estimates that about seventy-six million people in the United States become ill from foodborne pathogens or other agents every year. In North America, a number of government agencies work to educate the public about food infections and intoxications, prevent the spread of disease, and quell any major problems or outbreaks. They include the CDC, the FDA, the USDA, and Health Canada, among other organizations.</p>

The USDA and the FDA enforce laws regarding the safety of domestic and imported food. In addition, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 gives the FDA authority over food ingredients. The CDC tracks outbreaks, identifies the causes of food infection and intoxication, and recommends ways to prevent foodborne illness. Other government agencies that play a role in protecting the public include the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a division of the USDA, which enforces laws regulating meat and poultry safety. The Agricultural Research Service, which is the research arm of the USDA, investigates a number of agricultural practices, including those related to animal and crop safety. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture conducts research and education programs on food safety for farmers and consumers. Also, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates public drinking water.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s01_p02">Government agencies also monitor the use of pesticides. The EPA approves pesticides and other chemicals used in agriculture, and sets limits on how much residue can remain on food. The FDA analyzes food for surface residue and waxes. Processing methods can either reduce or concentrate pesticide residue in foods. Therefore, the Food Quality Protection Act, which was passed in 1996, requires manufacturers to show that pesticide levels are safe for children.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s01_p03">In Canada, Health Canada works with local governments, industries, and consumers to establish food safety throughout the nation. The agency’s scientists assess health risks from foodborne contaminants, conduct research, and evaluate data to better understand the effects of pathogens, chemicals, and other foodborne agents on the body. Health Canada also monitors the levels of contaminants in foods and estimates the exposure of consumers. Another organization, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, enforces the safety policies and standards set by Health Canada. They safeguard livestock, along with crops and other plants, to protect the public.</p>

Companies and retailers determine the points during processing, packaging, shipping, or shelving where hazards could occur. Those companies or retailers must then take measures to prevent, control, or eliminate the potential for food contamination. The USDA requires the food industry to follow HACCP for meat and poultry, while the FDA requires it for seafood, low-acid canned-food, and juice. HACCP is voluntary for all other food products.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s02_p01">Refrigerate perishable foods quickly; they should not be left out for more than two hours. The refrigerator should be kept at 40°F (or 4°C) or colder, and checked periodically with a thermometer. Store eggs in a carton on a shelf in the refrigerator, and not on the refrigerator door where the temperature is warmest. Wrap meat packages tightly and store them at the bottom of the refrigerator, so juices won’t leak out onto other foods. Raw meat, poultry, and seafood should be kept in a refrigerator for only two days. Otherwise, they should be stored in the freezer, which should be kept at 0°F (or −18°C). Store potatoes and onions in a cool, dark place, but not under a sink because leakage from pipes could contaminate them. Empty cans of perishable foods or beverages that have been opened into containers, and promptly place them in a refrigerator. Also, be sure to consume leftovers within three to five days, so mold does not have a chance to grow.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s03_p01">Wash hands thoroughly with warm, soapy water for at least twenty seconds before preparing food and every time after handling raw foods. Washing hands is important for many reasons. One is to prevent cross-contamination between foods. Also, some pathogens can be passed from person to person, so hand washing can help to prevent this. Fresh fruits and vegetables should also be rinsed thoroughly under running water to clean off pesticide residue.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_050">California Department of Pesticide Regulation. “Pesticides and Food: How We Test for Safety.” <em class="emphasis">Pesticide Info: What You Should Know about Pesticides,</em> no. #E09/REV. Accessed December 21, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/dept/factshts/residu2">http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/dept/factshts/residu2</a>.</span> This is particularly important for produce that contains a high level of residue, such as apples, pears, spinach, and potatoes. Washing also removes most dirt and bacteria from the surface of produce.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s03_p02">Other tips to keep foods safe during preparation include defrosting meat, poultry, and seafood in the refrigerator, microwave, or in a water-tight plastic bag submerged in cold water. Never defrost at room temperature because that is an ideal temperature for bacteria to grow. Also, marinate foods in the refrigerator and discard leftover marinade after use because it contains raw juices. Always use clean cutting boards, which should be washed with soap and warm water by hand or in a dishwasher after each use. Another way to sanitize cutting boards is to rinse them with a solution of 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) chlorine bleach to about 1 liter (1 quart) of water. If possible, use separate cutting boards for fresh produce and for raw meat. Also, wash the top before opening canned foods to prevent dirt from coming into contact with food.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s04_p01">Cooked food is safe to eat only after it has been heated to a temperature that is high enough to kill bacteria. You cannot judge the state of “cooked” by color and texture alone. Instead, use a food thermometer to be sure. The appropriate minimum cooking temperature varies depending on the type of food. Seafood should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F, beef, lamb, and pork to 160°F, ground chicken and turkey to 165°F, poultry breasts to 170°F, and whole poultry and thighs to 180°F. When microwaving, rotate the dish and stir contents several times to ensure even cooking.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_s03_s05_p01">After food has been cooked, the possibility of bacterial growth increases as the temperature drops. So, food should be kept above the safe temperature of 140°F, using a heat source such as a chafing dish, warming tray, or slow cooker. Cold foods should be kept at 40°F or lower. When serving food, keep it covered to block exposure to any mold spores hanging in the air. Use plastic wrap to cover foods that you want to remain moist, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and salads. After a meal, do not keep leftovers at room temperature for more than two hours. They should be refrigerated as promptly as possible. It is also helpful to date leftovers, so they can be used within a safe time, which is generally three to five days when stored in a refrigerator.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_p01">As we near the end of our journey in the world of health and nutrition, let’s address how to adjust your lifestyle today to ensure better health and wellness tomorrow. Adopting sustainable practices can go a long way toward helping you achieve optimal health, while also helping to protect the health of our planet. Remember, that sustainability involves meeting present nutritional needs while preserving resources for the future. It includes agricultural practices and processes, along with the choices that consumers make when they shop for their food. Ideally, sustainable practices include methods that are healthy, conserve the environment, protect livestock, respect food industry workers, provide fair wages to farmers, and support farming communities. When a practice or a process is sustainable, it can be maintained for decades, or even centuries, to come.</p>
    <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Living a Sustainable Lifestyle</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s01_p01">There are a number of steps you can take to live a more sustainable lifestyle. Utilizing an environmentally-friendly approach to good nutrition is a great way to remain and stay healthy. As an initial step, you might try to buy more whole foods rather than processed foods. You might also drink more water, rather than sodas and juices with added sugar. It is also a good idea to drink from a reusable water bottle to avoid adding more plastic to your local landfill, not to mention saving the fuel it takes to ship bottles of water. Here are some other suggestions to live a more sustainable lifestyle:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Learn more about food.</strong> Learn about your local food system, what is native to the area, what is imported or shipped in, how food moves from farms to processors to retail in your area, and what practices are used. Read labels to see where food comes from and what the growing and processing practices are. You might also try taking a cooking class to learn more about food in general.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Eat a plant-based diet.</strong> A plant-based diet is not necessarily vegetarian or vegan; it simply emphasizes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes over meat and poultry. Plant-based foods are good sources of carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals. They also help to decrease your risk for cancer and other chronic conditions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Support local farmers.</strong> Purchase more locally grown food to promote sustainability. This could involve going to a farmer’s market or a nearby farm. Locally grown food requires less fossil fuel because it does not have to travel great distances. Locally grown food also puts money back into your community and helps farmers in your area. Shopping at a farmer’s market or a local farm may also provide an opportunity to talk to the farmer who grew the food to learn more about what you put on your plate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Join a community garden.</strong> You can’t get more local than food that is grown in your own backyard. Consider growing your own food, or trying a community garden if you do not have the space at your home. Produce from a local garden will not only be fresher, it will often taste better. In addition, it will provide an opportunity to get to know like-minded individuals in your community.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Help spread the word.</strong> Talk to friends and family members about food, nutrition, and living a sustainable lifestyle. Also, pay attention to food and nutrition policy at the federal, state, and local levels. Take a look at what foods are available in your community. Are there supermarkets or corner stores? What is available in the university dining hall? If healthy options are lacking, can you talk to someone to bring about changes?</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tools for Change</h3>
            <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s01_p07">Another option to support local farmers is to sign up for a CSA (community-supported agriculture). Prior to a planting season, consumers who join a CSA purchase a produce share from a local farmer. When harvesting begins, farmers provide in-season, locally grown vegetables to shareholders at a local drop spot each week throughout the growing season. Some CSAs also include fruit, dairy products, meat, and more. CSA farmers often will allow you to visit the farm to learn more about the crops they grow or even volunteer to help with the harvest. Joining a CSA provides a direct connection between the local farming community and you.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s02_p01">Living a sustainable lifestyle and achieving optimal health is not easy. Taking steps to exercise more, eat healthier foods, and work harder to avoid food contamination may involve making major changes in your life. However, change is a process, and researchers have long studied the various stages of that process, as well as what helps or hinders it. While creating and implementing change is not easy, the more conscious you are of the process, and the more you prepare, the greater the chances are for success. Learning about the different stages of behavioral change can help you take a proactive approach to living a sustainable lifestyle.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Transtheoretical Model of Behavioral Change</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s02_s01_p01">The Transtheoretical Model of Behavioral Change identifies the five stages of change, along with things that can help people move through these different stages. It also includes strategies which help people make, create, and continue behavioral change. Learning about these different stages and techniques helps you decide how to best approach making healthy changes in your life. The five stages of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavioral Change are:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Precontemplation.</strong> At this stage, an individual has no plans to make any changes, and may not be aware that change is needed. For example, a person who has never thought of eating healthier or being more active is in the precontemplation stage. In this stage, a person often underestimates the pros of changing, and underestimates the cons of maintaining the status quo.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Contemplation.</strong> An individual begins to see the importance of altering behavior, and plans to do so within the next six months. Someone who has realized that they need to add more physical activity to their life, but hasn’t made any concrete plans to start doing it, is in the contemplation stage. Although they may be more aware of the benefits of change, the individual may still exaggerate the negative aspects of change.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Preparation.</strong> At this stage, an individual becomes serious about making a change, and plans to implement that change within thirty days. The person may have already started to alter behavior, or told friends about any plans or intentions. For example, someone who wants to eat better and has started gathering healthier recipes is in the preparation stage.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Action.</strong> At this point, an individual is in the midst of change or has made a consistent change in behavior within the past six months. For example, someone in the action stage would have started eating better and exercising on a regular basis.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Maintenance.</strong> At this final stage, an individual has successfully changed their behavior for six months or more and intends to maintain it in the future.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s02_s01_p02">Adopting a healthier lifestyle requires changes not only in behavior, but also in attitude and perception. The Transtheoretical Model calls them <em class="emphasis">decisional balance</em> and <em class="emphasis">self-efficacy</em>. Decisional balance means a person has realized that the benefits of making healthy changes outweigh any risks. Self-efficacy means a person has self-belief and the confidence to make and maintain positive changes. Both decisional balance and self-efficacy help people progress through the different stages of change. The Theoretical Model of Behavioral Change also includes ten techniques and strategies for bringing about change:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s02_s01_l02">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Consciousness-raising.</strong> Different methods that are used to raise awareness of healthier choices.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Dramatic Relief.</strong> The use of emotions through testimonials, role-playing, and the media to support change.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Environmental Reevaluation.</strong> Helping people become aware of how they affect others, and how a change on their part can also help those around them.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Social Liberation.</strong> Helping individuals realize that society may be more welcoming if they change their behavior.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Self-Liberation.</strong> Allowing people to believe in their ability to change, and make a commitment to it.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Helping Relationships.</strong> Providing connections between people seeking positive change with others who support their efforts.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Counterconditioning.</strong> Finding healthier substitutes for the unhealthy behavior.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Reinforcement Management.</strong> Increasing rewards for healthy behavior and reducing those for negative behavior.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stimulus Control.</strong> Being aware of and eliminating cues for unhealthy behavior, and replacing them with cues for healthy choices.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Self-reevaluation.</strong> Changing your self-image to fit with a newer, healthier lifestyle.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s05_s02_s01_p03">Some of these processes of change are more effective at different points in the process. A person who is not even contemplating change could tune out emotional appeals or reinforcement management. However, combining knowledge of the change process with the effective use of strategies can help everyone turn their good intentions into healthier lifestyles.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_051">Center for Health Communications Research. “Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change).” © 2009 The Regents of University of Michigan.

Both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dietitians</a><span class="glossdef">Health-care professional who has registered credentials and can implement nutritional care.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nutritionists</a><span class="glossdef">Health-care professional who works in the field of nutrition, but does not have registered credentials.</span></span> provide nutrion-related services to people in the private and public sectors. A dietitian is a healthcare professional who has registered credentials and can provide nutritional care in the areas of health and wellness for both individuals and groups. A nutritionist is an unregistered professional who may have the credentials of a dietitian, or may have acquired the knowledge via other avenues. People in both professions work to apply nutritional science, using evidence-based best practices, to help people nourish their bodies and improve their lives.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s06_p02">Becoming a registered dietitian requires a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in dietetics, including courses in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, anatomy and physiology, nutrition, and food-service management. Other suggested courses include economics, business, statistics, computer science, psychology, and sociology. In addition, people who pursue this path must complete a dietetic internship and pass a national exam. Also, some states have licensure that requires additional forms and documentation. To become a registered dietetic technician you must complete a dietetic technician program that involves supervised practice. Forty-seven states have licensure requirements for registered dietitians and nutritionists. A few remaining states do not have laws that regulate this profession.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_052">Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Dietitians and Nutritionists.” <em class="emphasis">Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition.</em> Last modified April 7, 2010. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos077..htm">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos077.htm</a>.</span> Go to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdrnet.org/certifications/licensure/index.cfm">http://www.cdrnet.org/certifications/licensure/index.cfm</a> to learn more.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Working in Nutrition</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s06_s01_p01">Dietitians and nutritionists plan food and nutrition programs, promote healthy eating habits, and recommend dietary modifications. For example, a dietitian might teach a patient with hypertension how to follow the DASH diet and reduce their sodium intake. Nutrition-related careers can be extremely varied. Some individuals work in the government, while others are solely in the private sector. Some jobs in nutrition focus on working with athletes, while others provide guidance to patients with long-term, life-threatening diseases. But no matter the circumstance or the clientele, working in the field of diet and nutrition focuses on helping people improve their dietary habits by translating nutritional science into food choices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s06_s01_p02">In the public sector, careers in nutrition span from government work to community outreach. Nutritionists and dietitians who work for the government may become involved with federal food programs, federal agencies, communication campaigns, or creating and analyzing public policy. On the local level, clinical careers include working in hospitals and nursing-care facilities. This requires creating meal plans and providing nutritional guidance to help patients restore their health or manage chronic conditions. Clinical dietitians also confer with doctors and other health-care professionals to coordinate dietary recommendations with medical needs. Nutrition jobs in the community often involve working in public health clinics, cooperative extension offices, and HMOs to prevent disease and promote the health of the local community. Nutrition jobs in the nonprofit world involve antihunger organizations, public health organizations, and activist groups.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s06_s01_p03">Nutritionists and dietitians can also find work in the private sector. Increased public awareness of food, diet, and nutrition has led to employment opportunities in advertising, marketing, and food manufacturing. Dietitians working in these areas analyze foods, prepare marketing materials, or report on issues such as the impact of vitamins and herbal supplements. Consultant careers can include working in wellness programs, supermarkets, physicians’ offices, gyms, and weight-loss clinics. Consultants in private practice perform nutrition screenings for clients and use their findings to provide guidance on diet-related issues, such as weight reduction. Nutrition careers in the corporate world include designing wellness strategies and nutrition components for companies, working as representatives for food or supplement companies, designing marketing and educational campaigns, and becoming lobbyists. Others in the private sector work in food-service management at health-care facilities or at company and school cafeterias. Sustainable agricultural practices are also providing interesting private sector careers on farms and in food systems.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s06_s02_p01">Whether you pursue nutrition as a career or simply work to improve your own dietary choices, what you have learned in this course can provide a solid foundation for the future. Remember, your ability to wake up, to think clearly, communicate, hope, dream, go to school, gain knowledge, and earn a living are totally dependent upon one factor—your health. Good health allows you to function normally and work hard to pursue your goals. Yet, achieving optimal health cannot be underestimated. It is a complex process, involving multiple dimensions of wellness, along with your physical or medical reality. The knowledge you have now acquired is also key. However, it is not enough to pass this nutrition class with good grades. Nutrition knowledge must be applied to make a difference in your life, throughout your life.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s06_s02_p02">Throughout this textbook, we have focused on the different aspects of nutritional science, which helps to optimize health and prevent disease. Scientific evidence provides the basis for dietary guidelines and recommendations. In addition, researchers in the field of nutrition work to advance our knowledge of food production and distribution. Nutritional science also examines the ill effects of malnutrition and food insecurity. The findings that are uncovered today will influence not only what we eat, but how we grow it, distribute it, prepare it, and even enjoy it tomorrow.</p>
