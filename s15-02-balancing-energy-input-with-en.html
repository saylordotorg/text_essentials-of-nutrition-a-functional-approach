        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p01">Recall that the macronutrients you consume are either converted to energy, stored, or used to synthesize macromolecules. A nutrient’s metabolic path is dependent upon <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">energy balance</a><span class="glossdef">When energy intake is equal to energy expended.</span></span>. When you are in a positive energy balance the excess nutrient energy will be stored or used to grow (e.g., during childhood, pregnancy, and wound healing). When you are in negative energy balance you aren’t taking in enough energy to meet your needs, so your body will need to use its stores to provide energy. Energy balance is achieved when intake of energy is equal to energy expended. Weight can be thought of as a whole body estimate of energy balance; body weight is maintained when the body is in energy balance, lost when it is in negative energy balance, and gained when it is in positive energy balance. In general, weight is a good predictor of energy balance, but many other factors play a role in energy intake and energy expenditure. Some of these factors are under your control and others are not. Let us begin with the basics on how to estimate energy intake, energy requirement, and energy output. Then we will consider the other factors that play a role in maintaining energy balance and hence, body weight.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_s01_p01">To maintain body weight you have to balance the calories obtained from food and beverages with the calories expended every day. Here, we will discuss how to calculate your energy needs in kilocalories per day so that you can determine whether your caloric intake falls short, meets, or exceeds your energy needs. The Institute of Medicine has devised a formula for calculating your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Estimated Energy Requirement (EER)</a><span class="glossdef">Energy intake values that have been established to preserve energy balance in healthy adults of a specific age, gender, weight, and height, and category of physical activity concurrent with good health.</span></span>. It takes into account your age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level (PA). The EER is a standardized mathematical prediction of a person’s daily energy needs in kilocalories per day required to maintain weight. It is calculated via the following formulas:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_s02_p03">The numbers within the equations for the EER were derived from measurements taken from a group of people of the same sex and age with similar body size and physical activity level. These standardized formulas are then applied to individuals whose measurements have not been taken, but who have similar characteristics in order to estimate their energy requirements. Thus, a person’s EER is, as the name suggests, an estimate for an average person of similar characteristics. EER values are different for children, pregnant or lactating women, and for overweight and obese people. Also, remember the EER is calculated based on weight maintenance, not for weight loss or weight gain.</p>

The sum of caloric expenditure is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">total energy expenditure (TEE)</a><span class="glossdef">The sum of energy used for basal metabolism; energy required for food digestion and absorption and energy expended during physical activity.</span></span>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Basal metabolism</a><span class="glossdef">The metabolic pathways necessary to support and maintain basic body functions (e.g. breathing, heartbeat, liver and kidney function) while at rest.</span></span> refers to those metabolic pathways necessary to support and maintain the body’s basic functions (e.g. breathing, heartbeat, liver and kidney function) while at rest. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy required by the body to conduct its basic functions over a certain time period. The great majority of energy expended (between 50 and 70 percent) daily is from conducting life’s basic processes. Of all the organs, the liver requires the most energy (see <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_s03_t01">Table 11.5 "Energy Breakdown of Organs"</a>). Unfortunately, you cannot tell your liver to ramp up its activity level to expend more energy so you can lose weight. BMR is dependent on body size, body composition, sex, age, nutritional status, and genetics. People with a larger frame size have a higher BMR simply because they have more mass. Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue even while at rest and thus the more muscle mass a person has, the higher their BMR. Since females typically have less muscle mass and a smaller frame size than men, their BMRs are generally lower than men’s. As we get older muscle mass declines and thus so does BMR. Nutritional status also affects basal metabolism. Caloric restriction, as occurs while dieting, for example, causes a decline in BMR. This is because the body attempts to maintain homeostasis and will adapt by slowing down its basic functions to offset the decrease in energy intake. Body temperature and thyroid hormone levels are additional determinants of BMR.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_s01_p01">In the last few decades scientific studies have revealed that how much we eat and what we eat is controlled not only by our own desires, but also is regulated physiologically and influenced by genetics. The hypothalamus in the brain is the main control point of appetite. It receives hormonal and neural signals, which determine if you feel hungry or full. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hunger</a><span class="glossdef">An unpleasant sensation of feeling empty that is communicated from the periphery to the brain via both mechanical and chemical signals.</span></span> is an unpleasant sensation of feeling empty that is communicated to the brain by both mechanical and chemical signals from the periphery.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_s01_p02">Hunger pangs are real and so is a “growling” stomach. When the stomach is empty it contracts, producing the characteristic pang and “growl.” The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural signals to the hypothalamus, which relays other neural signals to parts of the brain. This results in the conscious feeling of the need to eat. Alternatively, after you eat a meal the stomach stretches and sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety and relaying the message to stop eating. The stomach also sends out certain hormones when it is full and others when it is empty. These hormones communicate to the hypothalamus and other areas of the brain either to stop eating or to find some food.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_s01_p03">Fat tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake. Fat tissue produces the hormone leptin, which communicates to the satiety center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy balance. The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked a craze in the research world and in the diet pill industry as it was hypothesized that if you give leptin to a person who is overweight, they will decrease their food intake. Alas, this is not the case. In several clinical trials it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as well to it.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_002">Dardeno, T. A. et al. “Leptin in Human Physiology and Therapeutics.” <em class="emphasis">Front Neuroendocrinol</em> 31, no. 3 (2010): 377–93. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2916735/?tool=pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2916735/?tool=pubmed</a>.</span> Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese person there is no sustained effect on food intake.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_s01_p04">Nutrients themselves also play a role in influencing food intake. The hypothalamus senses nutrient levels in the blood. When they are low the hunger center is stimulated, and when they are high the satiety center is stimulated. Furthermore, cravings for salty and sweet foods have an underlying physiological basis. Both undernutrition and overnutrition affect hormone levels and the neural circuitry controlling appetite, which makes losing or gaining weight a substantial physiological hurdle.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_s02_p01">Genetics certainly play a role in body fatness and weight and also affects food intake. Children who have been adopted typically are similar in weight and body fatness to their biological parents. Moreover, identical twins are twice as likely to be of similar weights as compared to fraternal twins. The scientific search for obesity genes is ongoing and a few have been identified, such as the gene that encodes for leptin. However, overweight and obesity that manifests in millions of people is not likely to be attributed to one or even a few genes, but to rather the interactions of hundreds of genes with the environment. In fact, when an individual has a mutated version of the gene coding for leptin, they are obese, but only a few dozen people around the world have been identified as having a completely defective leptin gene.</p>

A person’s perception of good-smelling and good-tasting food influences what they eat and how much they eat. Mood and emotions are associated with food intake.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_s03_p02">Certain behaviors can be predictive of how much a person eats. Some of these are how much food a person heaps onto their plate, how often they snack on calorie-dense, salty foods, how often they watch television or sit at a computer, and how often they eat out. A study published in a 2008 issue of <em class="emphasis">Obesity</em> looked at characteristics of Chinese buffet patrons.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_s04_p01">It is without a doubt that the American society affects what and how much we eat. Portion sizes have increased dramatically in the past few decades. For example, a bagel is now more than twice the size it was in the 1960s. Today, American teenagers have access to a massive amount of calorie-dense foods and beverages, which is a large contributor to the recent rapid increase in overweight and obesity in adolescents in this country. Even different cultures within the United States have different eating habits. For instance, southern Americans, in general, consume more foods high in fat, which is a contributing factor to their higher incidences of overweight and obesity than Americans who live in the northern states. (Alaska is an exception because it also has a high incidence of overweight and obesity, which is also partly attributed to diet.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_s04_p02">The fast food industry in America not only supplies Americans with a large proportion of their diet, but because of its massive presence in society dominates the workings of the entire food system (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_s04_n01">Note 11.23 "Video 11.1"</a>). To generalize, most fast food items have little nutritional merit as they are highly processed and rich in saturated fat, salt, and added sugars. Despite fast foods being a poor source of nourishment, Americans spend over one hundred billion dollars per year on fast food, up from six billion dollars in the early 1970s. The fast food business is likely to continue to grow in North America (and the rest of the world) and greatly affect the diets of whole populations. Because it is unrealistic to say that Americans should abruptly quit eating fast food to save their health (because they will not) society needs to come up with ideas that push nutrient-dense whole foods into the fast food industry. You may have observed that this largely consumer-driven push is having some effect on the foods the fast food industry serves (just watch a recent Subway commercial, or check the options now available in a McDonald’s Happy Meal). Pushing the fast food industry to serve healthier foods is a realistic and positive way to improve the American diet.</p>

                <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_s04_p03">Support the consumer movement of pushing the fast food industry and your favorite local restaurants into serving more nutrient-dense foods. You can begin this task by starting simple, such as requesting extra tomatoes and lettuce on your burger and more nutrient-dense choices in the salad bar. Also, choose their low-calorie menu options and help support the emerging market of healthier choices in the fast food industry. In today’s fast-paced society, it is difficult for most people to avoid fast food all the time. When you do need a quick bite on the run, choose the fast food restaurants that serve healthier foods. Also, start asking for caloric contents of foods so that the restaurant becomes more aware that their patrons are being calorie conscious.</p>

This set point can also be called a fat-stat or lipostat, meaning the brain senses body fatness and triggers changes in energy intake or expenditure to maintain body fatness within a target range. Some believe that this theory provides an explanation as to why after dieting, most people return to their original weight not long after stopping the diet. Another theory is referred to as the “settling” point system, which takes into account (more so than the “set-point” theory) the contribution of the obesogenic environment to weight gain. In this model, the reservoir of body fatness responds to energy intake or energy expenditure, such that if a person is exposed to a greater amount of food, body fatness increases, or if a person watches more television body fatness increases. A major problem with these theories is that they overgeneralize and do not take into account that not all individuals respond in the same way to changes in food intake or energy expenditure. This brings up the importance of the interactions of genes and the environment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s03_s01_p02">Not all individuals who take a weight-loss drug lose weight and not all people who smoke are thin. An explanation for these discrepancies is that each individual’s genes respond differently to a specific environment. Alternatively, environmental factors can influence a person’s gene profile, which is exemplified by the effects of the prenatal environment on body weight and fatness and disease incidence later in life. One of the first scientific investigations of prenatal control over energy balance was conducted in Germany. In this observational study, scientists found that offspring born to mothers who experienced famine were more likely to be obese in adulthood than offspring born to mothers who were pregnant just after World War II who lived in the same geographical locations.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_004">Matthews, C. E. “Amount of Time Spent in Sedentary Behaviors in the United States, 2003–2004.” <em class="emphasis">Am J Epidemiol</em> 167, no. 7 (2008): 875–81. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwm390.</span> Other studies have shown that the offspring of women who were overweight during pregnancy have a greater propensity for being overweight and for developing Type 2 diabetes. Thus, undernutrition and overnutrition during pregnancy influence body weight and disease risk for offspring later in life. They do so by adapting energy metabolism to the early nutrient and hormonal environment in the womb.</p>

Of course, the sedentary lifestyle of many North Americans contributes to their average energy expenditure in daily life. Simply put, the more you sit, the less energy you expend. A study published in a 2008 issue of the <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Epidemiology</em> reports that 55 percent of Americans spend 7.7 hours in sedentary behavior daily.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_005">Matthews, C.

A study published in the June 2001 issue of the <em class="emphasis">International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity</em> reports that even breaking up sitting-time with frequent, but brief increased energy expenditure activities, such as walking for five minutes every hour, helps maintain weight and even aids in weight loss.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_006">Wu, Y. “Overweight and Obesity in China.” <em class="emphasis">Br Med J</em> 333, no. 7564 (2006): 362. doi: 10.1136/bmj.333.7564.362.</span> Americans partake in an excessive amount of screen time, which is a sedentary behavior that not only reduces energy expenditure, but also contributes to weight gain because of the exposure to aggressive advertising campaigns for unhealthy foods.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Societal Influence</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s03_s03_p01">In the United States, many societal factors influence the number of calories burned in a day. Escalators, moving walkways, and elevators (not to mention cars!) are common modes of transportation that reduce average daily energy expenditure. Office work, high-stress jobs, and occupations requiring extended working hours are all societal pressures that reduce the time allotted for exercise of large populations of Americans. Even the remote controls that many have for various electronic devices in their homes contribute to the US society being less active. More “obesogenic” factors were discussed in the opening of this chapter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s03_s03_s03_p02">Socioeconomic status has been found to be inversely proportional to weight gain. One reason for this relationship is that inhabitants of low-income neighborhoods have reduced access to safe streets and parks for walking. Another is that fitness clubs are expensive and few are found in lower-income neighborhoods. The recent and long-lasting economic crisis in this country is predicted to have profound effects on the average body weight of Americans. The number of homeless in this country is rising with many children and adults living in hotels and cars. As you can imagine neither of these “home spaces” has a kitchen, making it impossible to cook nutritious meals and resulting in increased economically-forced access to cheap, unhealthy foods, such as that at a nearby gas station.</p>

                    <li>Energy balance is achieved when energy intake is equal to energy expended. Energy balance is essential for maintaining weight.</li>
                    <li>Knowing the number of calories you need each day is a useful reference point, but it is also important to obtain your calories from nutrient-dense foods and consume the macronutrients in their AMDRs.</li>
                    <li>The amount of energy you expend every day includes not only the calories you burn during physical activity, but also the calories you burn at rest (basal metabolism), and the calories you burn when you digest food.</li>
                    <li>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is dependent on body size, body composition, sex, age, nutritional status, genetics, body temperature, and thyroid hormone levels.</li>
                    <li>The great majority of energy expended (between 50 and 70 percent) daily comes from conducting life’s basic processes.</li>
                    <li>The main control a person has over TEE is to increase physical activity.</li>
                    <li>Energy intake is regulated by complex physiological responses and is influenced by genetics, behavior, and society.</li>
                    <li>Energy expenditure is also regulated by complex physiological responses and is influenced by genetics, behavior, and society.</li>
