    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s05_p02">Successful weight loss is defined as individuals intentionally losing at least 10 percent of their body weight and keeping it off for at least one year.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_016">Wing, R. R. and J. O. Hill. “Successful Weight Loss Maintenance.” <em class="emphasis">Annu Rev Nutr</em> 21 (2001): 323–41.

An evaluation of successful weight loss, involving more than fourteen thousand participants published in the November 2011 issue of the <em class="emphasis">International Journal of Obesity</em> estimates that more than one in six Americans who were overweight or obese were successful in achieving long-term weight loss.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_017">Kraschnewski, J. L. et al. “Long-Term Weight Loss Maintenance in the United States.” <em class="emphasis">Int J Obes</em> 34, no. 11 (2010): 1644–54. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479763">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479763</a>.</span> However, these numbers are on the high end because many similar studies report fewer than 10 percent of participants as successful in weight loss.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s05_p03">The National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) tracks over ten thousand people who have been successful in losing at least 30 pounds and maintaining this weight loss for at least one year. Their research findings are that 98 percent of participants in the registry modified their food intake and 94 percent increased their physical activity (mainly walking.)<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_018">The National Weight Control Registry. “Research Findings.” Accessed October 8, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nwcr.ws/Research/default.htm">http://www.nwcr.ws/Research/default.htm</a>.</span> Although there are a great variety of approaches taken by NWCR members to achieve successful weight loss, most report that their approach involved adhering to a low-calorie, low-fat diet and doing high levels of activity (about one hour of exercise per day). Moreover, most members eat breakfast every day, watch fewer than ten hours of television per week, and weigh themselves at least once per week. About half of them lost weight on their own and the other half used some type of weight-loss program. In most scientific studies successful weight loss is accomplished only by changing the diet <em class="emphasis">and</em> by increasing physical activity. Doing one without the other limits the amount of weight lost and the length of time that weight loss is sustained. On an individual level it is quite possible to achieve successful weight loss, as over ten thousand Americans can attest. Moreover, losing as little as 10 percent of your body weight can significantly improve health and reduce disease risk.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_019">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. “Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults: The Evidence Report.” <em class="emphasis">Obes Res</em> 6 supplement (1998): 51S–210S. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2003/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2003/</a>.</span> You do not have to be overweight or obese to reap benefits from eating a healthier diet and increasing physical activity as both provide numerous benefits beyond weight loss and maintenance.</p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Increase intake of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits.</strong> Scientific evidence demonstrates that adults who have a higher intake of whole grains, mainly those high in dietary fiber, have lower body weights compared to adults who eat a smaller amount of whole grains. Moreover diets incorporating more whole grains reduce chronic disease risk (see <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch04#zimmerman_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Carbohydrates"</a>). A higher intake of fruits and vegetables is scientifically shown to protect against weight gain in adults and there is some evidence that this is also true for children and adolescents (see <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch08#zimmerman_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Nutrients Important As Antioxidants"</a> for detailed information and the benefits to health of eating a variety of fruits and vegetables).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Reduce intake of sugar-sweetened beverages.</strong> There is good evidence that reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, especially in children and adolescents, decreases body weight and reduces chronic disease risk (see <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch04#zimmerman_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Carbohydrates"</a> for detailed information).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Monitor intake of 100 percent fruit juice for children and adolescents, especially those who are overweight or obese.</strong> There is some evidence that increased intake of 100 percent juice exacerbates weight problems in children and adolescents who are already overweight or obese.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Monitor calorie intake from alcoholic beverages for adults.</strong> Drinking in moderation is not linked to weight gain; however, excessive intake of alcohol over time is associated with weight gain.</li>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Focus on the total number of calories consumed.</strong> Reducing calorie intake improves health and aids in weight management.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Monitoring food and caloric intake.</strong> Being more aware of the calories in foods and beverages by reading the Nutrition Facts panel is helpful for consumers to monitor intake. Vigilant monitoring of food and caloric intake assists in weight management.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">When eating out, choose smaller portions or lower-calorie options.</strong> As mentioned in an earlier section of this chapter, eating out more often, especially at fast food restaurants, contributes to weight gain. The <em class="emphasis">Dietary Guidelines</em> advise people that when they are eating out to order smaller portions, share meals when possible, or take home part of the meal.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Prepare, serve, and consume smaller portions of foods and beverages, especially those high in calories.</strong> Having less on your plate helps you eat less.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Eat a nutrient-dense breakfast.</strong> The old adage that “breakfast is the most important meal of the day” holds true when you consider that not eating breakfast is associated with higher body weights, especially among children and adolescents. Moreover, eating a nutrient-dense breakfast has in some scientific studies been shown to stimulate weight loss.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Limit screen time.</strong> In children, adolescents, and adults, the sedentary activities of watching television and spending time on the computer are linked to increased overweight and obesity. The <em class="emphasis">Dietary Guidelines</em> recommend children and adolescents spend no more than one to two hours daily watching television, playing electronic games, or using the computer (other than for homework).<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_021">US Department of Agriculture. <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em>. 2010.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s05_s03_p01">The other part of the energy balance equation is physical activity. The <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines</em> are complemented by the <em class="emphasis">2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</em> issued by the Department of Health and Human Services in an effort to provide evidence-based guidelines for appropriate physical activity levels. The <em class="emphasis">2008 Physical Activity Guidelines</em> provide guidance to Americans aged six and older about how to improve health and reduce chronic disease risk through physical activity. Increased physical activity has been found in scientific studies to lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, colon, breast, and lung cancer, falls and fractures, depression, and dying early. Increased physical activity not only reduces disease risk, but also improves overall health by increasing cardiovascular and muscular fitness, increasing bone density and strength, improving cognitive function, and assisting in weight loss and weight maintenance. The key guidelines for adults are the following (those for pregnant women, children, and older people will be given in <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch12#zimmerman_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Nutrition through the Life Cycle: From Pregnancy to the Toddler Years"</a> and <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch13#zimmerman_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "Nutrition through the Life Cycle: From Childhood to the Elderly Years"</a>):<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_022">US Department of Health and Human Services. <em class="emphasis">2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</em>. 2008.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s05_s04_p01">On a national level, strategies addressing overweight and obesity in the past have not been all that successful as obesity levels continue to climb. However, in the recent past (2007–2011) several newly created initiatives and organizations are actively reinforcing strategies aimed to meet the challenge of improving the health of all Americans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s05_s04_p02">In 2010 the national campaign to reduce obesity was reinforced when First Lady Michelle Obama launched the “Let’s Move” initiative, which has the goal of “solving the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight.”<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_024">The White House, Office of the First Lady. “First Lady Michelle Obama Launches Let’s Move: America’s Move to Raise a Healthier Generation of Kids.” February 9, 2010. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/first-lady-michelle-obama-launches-lets-move-americas-move-raise-a-healthier-genera">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/first-lady-michelle-obama-launches -lets-move-americas-move-raise-a-healthier-genera</a>.</span> Another campaign, “Campaign to End Obesity,” was recently established to try to enable more Americans to eat healthy and be active by bringing together leaders from academia and industry, as well as public-health policy-makers in order to create policies that will reverse the obesity trend and its associated diseases (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s05_s04_n01">Note 11.40 "Video Link 11.2"</a>).

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch11_s05_s05_p01">Currently, most people are not obese in this country. The gradual rise in overweight is happening because, on average, people consume slightly more calories daily than they expend, resulting in a gradual weight gain of one to two pounds a year. In 2003 the idea was first published that promoting small lifestyle changes to reduce weight gain occurring over time in all age groups may better reduce obesity rates in the American population.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn11_025">Hill, J.

                <li>Successful weight loss is defined as when individuals intentionally lose at least 10 percent of their body weight and keep it off for at least one year.</li>
                <li>Although there is a great variety of approaches to achieve successful weight loss most report that it involves adhering to a low-calorie, low-fat diet and doing high levels of activity (about one hour of exercise per day).</li>
                <li>The <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em> recommendations are based upon scientific evidence.</li>
                <li>The other part of the energy balance equation is physical activity. The <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines</em> were complemented by the <em class="emphasis">2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</em> issued by the HHS in an effort to provide evidence-based guidelines for appropriate physical activity levels.</li>
                <li>On a national level, strategies addressing overweight and obesity in the past have not been all that successful as obesity levels continue to climb. However, in the recent past (2007–2011) several newly created initiatives and organizations are actively reinforcing strategies that aim to meet the challenge of improving the health of all Americans.</li>
