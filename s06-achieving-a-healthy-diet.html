        <h3 class="title">Big Idea</h3>
        <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s00_p01">The dietary toolkit contains numerous ideas to help you achieve a healthy diet.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s00_p02">Let’s talk about a toolkit for a healthy diet. The first thing in it would be the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs). Then we could add the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs), and the Tolerable Upper Limits (ULs). All of these tools are values for important nutrients, calculated to meet the health needs of different age groups. But long before the dietary toolkit full of acronyms such as DRI, RDA, EAR, and UL, daily standards were created with the single goal of keeping workers alive and toiling in the factories and workhouses of the early Industrial Revolution. In the late nineteenth century powerhouse tycoons operated without fear of legal consequences and paid their workers as little as possible in order to maximize their own profits. Workers could barely afford housing, and depended on what their bosses fed them at the workhouses to fend off starvation.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s00_p04">Living conditions in those days show that the term “starvation wages” was not just a figure of speech. Here’s a typical day’s menu:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s00_l01">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Breakfast.</strong> 1 pint porridge, one 6-ounce piece of bread.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Lunch.</strong> Beef broth one day, boiled pork and potatoes the next.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Dinner.</strong> 1 pint porridge, one 6-ounce piece of bread.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s00_p05">As public awareness about these working conditions grew, so did public indignation. Experts were eventually called in to create the first dietary guidelines, which were designed only to provide a typical individual with what they needed to survive each day, and no more. It wasn’t until World War I that the British Royal Society first made recommendations about the nutrients people needed to be healthy, as opposed to merely surviving. They included ideas we now take for granted, such as making fruit and vegetables part of the diet and giving milk to children. Since then, most governments have established their own dietary standards. Food is a precious commodity, like energy, and controlling the way it is distributed confers power. Sometimes this power is used to influence other countries, as when the United States withholds food aid from countries with regimes of which it disapproves. Governments can also use their power over food to support their most fragile citizens with food relief programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Women, Infants, and Children Supplemental Food Program (WIC).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s00_p06">The US government has also established dietary standards to help citizens follow a healthy diet. The first of these were the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs), published in 1943 because of the widespread food shortages caused by World War II. During the war, the government rationed sugar, butter, milk, cheese, eggs, coffee, and canned goods. Limited transportation made it hard to distribute fruits and vegetables. To solve this problem, the government encouraged citizens to plant “victory gardens” to produce their own fruits and vegetables. More than twenty million people began planting gardens in backyards, empty lots, and on rooftops. Neighbors pooled their resources and formed cooperatives, planting in the name of patriotism.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s00_p07">Today in the United States, there are various measures used to maintain access to nutritious, safe, and sufficient food to the citizenry. Many of these dietary guidelines are provided by the government, and are found at the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) new website, ChooseMyPlate.gov. We call this collection of guidelines the “dietary toolkit.”</p>

        <h3 class="title">You Decide</h3>
        <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s00_p08">How will you use the dietary toolkit?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s00_p09">The government works to provide citizens with information, guidance, and access to healthy foods. How will you decide which information to follow? What are the elements of a healthy diet, and how do you figure out ways to incorporate them into your personal diet plan? The dietary toolkit can be likened to a mechanics toolkit, with every tool designed for a specific task(s). Likewise, there are many tools in the dietary toolkit that can help you build, fix, or maintain your diet for good health. In this chapter you will learn about many of the tools available to you.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s01_p01">“Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are” wrote the French lawyer and politician, Antheime Brillat-Savarin in his book, <em class="emphasis">Physiologie du Gout, ou Meditations de Gastronomie Transcendante</em>, in 1826. Almost one hundred years later, nutritionist Victor Lindlahr wrote in an ad in 1923, “Ninety percent of the diseases known to man are caused by cheap foodstuffs. You are what you eat.” Today, we know this phrase simply as, “You are what you eat.”<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_001">Phrase Finder. Accessed July 6, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/you%20are%20what%20you%20eat.html">http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/you%20are%20what%20you%20eat.html</a></span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s01_p02">Good nutrition equates to receiving enough (but not too much) of the macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and water) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) so that the body can stay healthy, grow properly, and work effectively. The phrase “you are what you eat” refers to the fact that your body will respond to the food it receives, either good or bad. Processed, sugary, high-fat, and excessively salted foods leave the body tired and unable to perform effectively. By contrast, eating fresh, natural whole foods fuels the body by providing what it needs to produce energy, promote metabolic activity, prevent micronutrient deficiencies, ward off chronic disease, and to promote a sense of overall health and well-being.</p>

For example, someone who is 150 pounds overweight can also be malnourished. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Malnutrition</a><span class="glossdef">A condition where one does not receive proper amounts of nutrients.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p02">Although not as prevalent in America as it is in developing countries, undernutrition is not uncommon and affects many subpopulations, including the elderly, those with certain diseases, and those in poverty. Many people who live with diseases either have no appetite or may not be able to digest food properly. Some medical causes of malnutrition include cancer, inflammatory bowel syndrome, AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, illnesses or conditions that cause chronic pain, psychiatric illnesses, such as anorexia nervosa, or as a result of side effects from medications. Overnutrition is an epidemic in the United States and is known to be a risk factor for many diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis), and cancer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_p01">From birth to adulthood, nutrients fuel proper growth and function of all body cells, tissue, and systems. Without proper amounts of nutrients, growth and development are stunted. Some nutrient deficiencies manifest right away, but sometimes the effects of undernutrition aren’t seen until later in life. For example, if children do not consume proper amounts of calcium and vitamin D, peak bone mass will be reduced compared to what it would be had adequate amounts of these nutrients been consumed. When adults enter old age without adequate bone mass, they are more susceptible to osteoporosis, putting them at risk for bone fractures. Therefore, it is vital to build bone strength through proper nutrition during youth because it cannot be done in later life.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_002">MedicineNet.com. “Nutrients for the Growing Years.” Last reviewed August 13, 2003. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10054">http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10054</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p02">A healthy diet is one that favors whole foods. As an alternative to modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh whole foods that have been sustaining people throughout the millenniums. Whole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health. Commercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients and often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and trans fats, all of which are associated with the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer, obesity, high cholesterol, diabetes, and other illnesses. A balanced diet is a mix of food from the different food groups (vegetables, legumes, fruits, grains, protein foods, and dairy).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_s02_p01">Balance the foods in your diet. Achieving balance in your diet entails not consuming one nutrient at the expense of another. For example, calcium is essential for healthy teeth and bones, but too much calcium will interfere with iron absorption. Most foods that are good sources of iron are poor sources of calcium, so in order to get the necessary amounts of calcium and iron from your diet, a proper balance between food choices is critical. Another example is that while sodium is a vital nutrient, an overabundance of it can contribute to congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Remember, everything must be consumed in the proper amounts.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Moderation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_s03_p01">Eat in moderation. Moderation is crucial for optimal health and survival. Burgers, French fries, cake, and ice cream each night for dinner will lead to health complications. But as part of an otherwise healthful diet and consumed only on a weekly basis, this should not have too much of an impact on overall health. If this is done once per month, it will have even less of an impact upon overall health. It’s important to remember that eating is, in part, about enjoyment and indulging with a spirit of moderation. This fits within a healthy diet.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_s04_p01">Monitor food portions. For optimum weight maintenance, it is important to ensure that energy consumed from foods meets the energy expenditures required for body functions and activity. If not, the excess energy contributes to gradual, steady weight gain. In order to lose weight, you need to ensure that more calories are burned than consumed. Likewise, in order to gain weight, calories must be eaten in excess of what is expended daily.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_s05_p01">Variety involves eating different foods from all the food groups. Eating a varied diet helps to ensure that you receive all the nutrients necessary for a healthy diet. One of the major drawbacks of a monotonous diet is the risk of consuming too much of some nutrients and not enough of others. Trying new foods can also be a source of pleasure—you never know what foods you might like until you try them.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s03_p01">The first US dietary recommendations were set by the National Academy of Sciences in 1941. The recommended dietary allowances (RDA) were first established out of concern that America’s overseas World War II troops were not consuming enough daily nutrients to maintain good health. The first Food and Nutrition Board was created in 1941, and in the same year set recommendations for the adequate intakes of caloric energy and eight essential nutrients. These were disseminated to officials responsible for food relief for armed forces and civilians supporting the war effort. Since 1980, the dietary guidelines have been reevaluated and updated every five years by the advisory committees of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The guidelines are continually revised to keep up with new scientific evidence-based conclusions on the importance of nutritional adequacy and physical activity to overall health. While dietary recommendations set prior to 1980 focused only on preventing nutrient inadequacy, the current dietary guidelines have the additional goals of promoting health, reducing chronic disease, and decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obesity.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_p01">Instituting nation-wide standard policies provides consistency across organizations and allows health-care workers, nutrition educators, school boards, and elder-care facilities to improve nutrition and subsequently the health of their respective populations. At the same time, the goal of the <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines</em> is to provide packaged informative guidelines that will help any interested person in obtaining optimal nutritional balance and health. The seventh edition of the <em class="emphasis">Dietary Guidelines</em> was released in 2010 and focuses mainly on combating the obesity epidemic. USDA secretary Tom Vilsack says, “The bottom line is that most Americans need to trim their waistlines to reduce the risk of developing diet-related chronic disease. Improving our eating habits is not only good for every individual and family, but also for our country.” The <em class="emphasis">Dietary Guidelines</em> are formulated by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) from the review of thousands of scientific journal articles by a consensus panel consisting of more than two thousand nutrition experts with the overall mission of improving the health of the nation.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_004">Johnson, T.D. “Online Only: New Dietary Guidelines Call for Less Salt, Fewer Calories, More Exercise.” <em class="emphasis">Nation’s Health</em> 41, no. 2 (March 2011): E6. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/content/41/2/E6.full">http://thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/content/41/2/E6.full</a>.</span></p>

In addition, increase the intake of seafood and fat-free and low-fat milk and milk products and consume only moderate amounts of lean meats, poultry, and eggs.</li>
            <li>Significantly reduce intake of foods containing solid fats and added sugars (SoFAS) because these dietary components contribute excess calories and few, if any, nutrients. In addition, reduce sodium intake and lower intake of refined grains that are coupled with added sugar, solid fat, and sodium.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_s03_p01">The <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines</em> recommend that people make an effort to reduce their caloric consumption, reduce the intake of nutrient-poor foods, and increase the intake of nutrient-dense foods. To accomplish these tasks it is necessary to incorporate moderation and variety. The goal is not only choosing specific foods for your diet, but also the development of a healthy eating pattern. Several studies provide good evidence that certain dietary patterns increase overall health and decrease the risk of chronic disease. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial, or DASH, reports that men and women who consumed more than eight servings per day of fruits and vegetables had lower blood pressures than a control group that consumed under four servings per day of fruits and vegetables.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_006">Sacks, F.M, et al., “Effects on Blood Pressure of Reduced Dietary Sodium and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet.” <em class="emphasis">N Engl J Med</em>. 344, no. 1 (January 2001): 3–10. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200101043440101">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200101043440101</a>.</span> Other studies investigating the benefits of the DASH diet have also found it to be protective against cardiovascular disease and decrease overall mortality. Another well-known diet is the Mediterranean diet. In general, the Mediterranean diet is described as one that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts, and olive oil as a replacement for butter. Few meats and high-fat dairy products are eaten. Observational studies have linked the Mediterranean diet to reduced cardiovascular disease and decreased mortality. Vegetarian diets, which emphasize many of the same foods as the DASH and Mediterranean diets have also been linked to a decrease in incidences of some chronic diseases.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p01">It is not just ourselves, the food industry, and federal government that shape our choices of food and physical activity, but also our sex, genetics, disabilities, income, religion, culture, education, lifestyle, age, and environment. All of these factors must be addressed by organizations and individuals that seek to make changes in dietary habits. The socioeconomic model incorporates all of these factors and is used by health-promoting organizations, such as the USDA and the HHS to determine multiple avenues through which to promote healthy eating patterns, to increase levels of physical activity, and to reduce the risk of chronic disease for all Americans. Lower economic prosperity influences diet specifically by lowering food quality, decreasing food choices, and decreasing access to enough food. As a result of the recent financial crisis in America the number of people who struggle to have enough to eat is rising and approaching fifty million. In response to these recent numbers, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack said, “These numbers are a wake-up call…for us to get very serious about food security and hunger, about nutrition and food safety in this country.”<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_009">Amy Goldstein, “Hunger a Growing Problem in America, USDA Reports,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, 17 November 2009. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/16/AR2009111601598.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/16/AR2009111601598.html</a>.</span></p>

To refrain from overeating try consuming small meals at frequent intervals throughout the day as opposed to two or three large meals. Eat until you are satisfied, not until you feel “stuffed.” Eating slowly and savoring your food allows you to both enjoy what you eat and have time to realize that you are full before you get overfull. Your stomach is about the size of your fist but it expands if you eat excessive amounts of food at one sitting. Eating smaller meals will diminish the size of your appetite over time so you will feel satisfied with smaller amounts of food.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_s03_p01">Seven out of every ten deaths in the United States are caused by chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and three-quarters of the country’s health spending goes toward the cost of treating these diseases. Helping people lose weight, maintain a healthy weight, and prevent chronic disease by improving dietary habits requires providing education about food and nutrition, assuring access to healthier food options, and promoting the desire and ability to become physically active. Some of the Healthy People 2020 program’s related objectives are discussed below.</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_s03_l01">

<strong class="emphasis bold">Improve health, fitness, and quality of life through daily physical activity.</strong> The Healthy People 2020 objectives for physical activity are based on the <em class="emphasis">2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</em>, and reflect the strong scientific evidence supporting the benefits of physical activity. More than 80 percent of the current US population, from youth to adults, is not meeting these guidelines. Healthy People 2020 highlights the way that one’s level of physical activity is affected by environmental factors such as the availability of safe sidewalks, bike lanes, trails, and parks. It also highlights the legislative policies that improve access to facilities that promote physical activity. Understanding that personal, social, economic, and environmental barriers to physical activity all have a part in determining a population’s physical activity level, is an important part of being able to provide interventions that foster physical activity. Consistent physical activity is necessary for preventing chronic disease, improving bone health, decreasing body fat, and preventing an early death.</li>

The financial burdens of preventable health problems and associated long-term costs of chronic diseases in this demographic group have the potential to be vast, and will be the result of attitudes and behaviors initiated during adolescence.

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_p01">For many years, the US government has been encouraging Americans to develop healthful dietary habits. In 1992 the food pyramid was introduced, and in 2005 it was updated. This was the symbol of healthy eating patterns for all Americans. However, some felt it was difficult to understand, so in 2011, the pyramid was replaced with Choose MyPlate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_p02">The Choose MyPlate program uses a tailored approach to give people the needed information to help design a healthy diet. The plate is divided according to the amount of food and nutrients you should consume for each meal. Each food group is identified with a different color, showing the food variety that all plates must have. Aside from educating people about the type of food that is best to support optimal health, the new food plan offers the advice that it is okay to enjoy food, just eat less of it.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_013">US Department of Agriculture.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Building a Healthy Plate: Choose Nutrient-Rich Foods</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_p01">Planning a healthy diet using the MyPlate approach is not difficult. According to the icon, half of your plate should have fruits and vegetables, one-quarter should have whole grains, and one-quarter should have protein. Dairy products should be low-fat or non-fat. The ideal diet gives you the most nutrients within the fewest calories. This means choosing nutrient-rich foods.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_p02">Fill half of your plate with red, orange, and dark green vegetables and fruits, such as kale, collard greens, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, broccoli, apples, oranges, grapes, bananas, blueberries, and strawberries in main and side dishes. Vary your choices to get the benefit of as many different vegetables and fruits as you can. You may choose to drink fruit juice as a replacement for eating fruit. (As long as the juice is 100 percent fruit juice and only half your fruit intake is replaced with juice, this is an acceptable exchange.) For snacks, eat fruits, vegetables, or unsalted nuts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_p05">Fill a quarter of your plate with whole grains such as 100 percent whole-grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, and pasta. Half of your daily grain intake should be whole grains. Read the ingredients list on food labels carefully to determine if a food is comprised of whole grains.</p>

            <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_p03">Consider the information in this video:</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_p04">Identify which vegetables and fruits are in season and local to your area. By consuming in-season, local foods you cut down on transportation costs (emission and financial) and you are likely to get fresher produce. You also support your local farms by purchasing their produce.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_p06">Select a variety of protein foods to improve nutrient intake and promote health benefits. Each week, be sure to include a nice array of protein sources in your diet, such as nuts, seeds, beans, legumes, poultry, soy, and seafood. The recommended consumption amount for seafood for adults is two 4-ounce servings per week. When choosing meat, select lean cuts. Be conscious to prepare meats using little or no added saturated fat, such as butter.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_p07">If you enjoy drinking milk or eating milk products, such as cheese and yogurt, choose low-fat or nonfat products. Low-fat and nonfat products contain the same amount of calcium and other essential nutrients as whole-milk products, but with much less fat and calories. Calcium, an important mineral for your body, is also available in lactose-free and fortified soy beverage and rice beverage products. You can also get calcium in vegetables and other fortified foods and beverages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_p08">Oils are essential for your diet as they contain valuable essential fatty acids, but the type you choose and the amount you consume is important. Be sure the oil is plant-based rather than based on animal fat. You can also get oils from many types of fish, as well as avocados, and unsalted nuts and seeds. Although oils are essential for health they do contain about 120 calories per tablespoon. It is vital to balance oil consumption with total caloric intake. The Nutrition Facts label provides the information to help you make healthful decisions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s01_p09">In short, substituting vegetables and fruit in place of unhealthy foods is a good way to make a nutrient-poor diet healthy again. Vegetables are full of nutrients and antioxidants that help promote good health and reduce the risk for developing chronic diseases such as stroke, heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Regularly eating fresh fruits and vegetables will boost your overall health profile.</p>

    <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Discretionary Calories</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s02_p01">When following a balanced, healthful diet with many nutrient-dense foods, you may consume enough of your daily nutrients before you reach your daily calorie limit. The remaining calories are discretionary (to be used according to your best judgment). To find out your discretionary calorie allowance, add up all the calories you consumed to achieve the recommended nutrient intakes and then subtract this number from your recommended daily caloric allowance. For example, someone who has a recommended 2,000-calorie per day diet may eat enough nutrient-dense foods to meet requirements after consuming only 1,814 calories. The remaining 186 calories are discretionary. These calories may be obtained from eating an additional piece of fruit, adding another teaspoon of olive oil on a salad or butter on a piece of bread, adding sugar or honey to cereal, or consuming an alcoholic beverage.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_014">US Department of Agriculture. “MyPyramid Education Framework.” Accessed July 22, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov">http://www.choosemyplate.gov</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s05_s02_p02">The amount of discretionary calories increases with physical activity level and decreases with age. For most physically active adults, the discretionary calorie allowance is, at most, 15 percent of the recommended caloric intake. By consuming nutrient-dense foods, you afford yourself a discretionary calorie allowance.</p>

This tool is a simple scoring system of dietary components. The data for scoring diets is taken from national surveys of particular population subgroups, such as children from low-income families or Americans over the age of sixty-five. Diets are broken down into several food categories including milk, whole fruits, dark green and orange vegetables, whole grains, and saturated fat, and then a score is given based on the amount consumed. For example, a score of ten is given if a 2,000-kilocalorie diet includes greater than 2.6 cups of milk per day. If less than 10 percent of total calories in a diet are from saturated fat, a score of eight is given. All of the scores are added up from the different food categories and the diets are given a HEI score. Using this standardized diet-assessment tool at different times, every ten years for instance, the CNPP can determine if the eating habits of certain groups of the American population are getting better or worse. The HEI tool provides the federal government with information to make policy changes to better the diets of American people.

                <li>The Food Pyramid has been replaced by MyPlate, a system that was designed to be easier to implement. The new MyPlate encourages all plates to be filled with fruits and vegetables (50 percent), protein (25 percent), and grains (25 percent). Half of daily grain intake should be from whole-grain sources. Dairy choices should be switched to low-fat or non-fat sources.</li>
                <li>A diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables will help you lose and/or maintain weight, will lower your risk for stroke, heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer, and will boost your overall health profile.</li>
                <li>By choosing nutrient-dense foods, you may have discretionary calories to “spend” at the end of the day.</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s06_s01_p02">The DRIs are not minimum or maximum nutritional requirements and are not intended to fit everybody. They are to be used as guides only for the majority of the healthy population.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_016">Deng, S., B. J. West, and C. J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s06_s01_p03">DRIs are important not only to help the average person determine whether their intake of a particular nutrient is adequate, they are also used by health-care professionals and policy makers to determine nutritional recommendations for special groups of people who may need help reaching nutritional goals. This includes people who are participating in programs such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The DRI is not appropriate for people who are ill or malnourished, even if they were healthy previously.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Determining Dietary Reference Intakes</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s06_s01_s01_p01">Each DRI value is derived in a different way. See below for an explanation of how each is determined:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s06_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Estimated Average Requirements.</strong> The EAR for a nutrient is determined by a committee of nutrition experts who review the scientific literature to determine a value that meets the requirements of 50 percent of people in their target group within a given life stage and for a particular sex. The requirements of half of the group will fall below the EAR and the other half will be above it. It is important to note that, for each nutrient, a specific bodily function is chosen as the criterion on which to base the EAR. For example, the EAR for calcium is set using a criterion of maximizing bone health. Thus, the EAR for calcium is set at a point that will meet the needs, with respect to bone health, of half of the population. EAR values become the scientific foundation upon which RDA values are set.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Recommended Daily Allowances.</strong> Once the EAR of a nutrient has been established, the RDA can be mathematically determined. While the EAR is set at a point that meets the needs of half the population, RDA values are set to meet the needs of the vast majority (97 to 98 percent) of the target healthy population. It is important to note that RDAs are not the same thing as individual nutritional requirements. The actual nutrient needs of a given individual will be different than the RDA. However, since we know that 97 to 98 percent of the population’s needs are met by the RDA, we can assume that if a person is consuming the RDA of a given nutrient, they are most likely meeting their nutritional need for that nutrient. The important thing to remember is that the RDA is meant as a <em class="emphasis">recommendation</em> and meeting the RDA means it is very likely that you are meeting your actual <em class="emphasis">requirement</em> for that nutrient.</li>

                <h3 class="title">Understanding the Difference</h3>
                <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s06_s01_s01_p02">There is a distinct difference between a requirement and a recommendation. For instance, the DRI for vitamin D is a <em class="emphasis">recommended</em> 600 international units each day. However, in order to find out your true personal <em class="emphasis">requirements</em> for vitamin D, a blood test is necessary. The blood test will provide an accurate reading from which a medical professional can gauge your required daily vitamin D amounts. This may be considerably more or less than the DRI, depending on what your level actually is.</p>
            </div>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s06_s01_s01_l02" continuation="continues">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Adequate Intake.</strong> AIs are created for nutrients when there is insufficient consistent scientific evidence to set an EAR for the entire population. As with RDAs, AIs can be used as nutrient-intake goals for a given nutrient. For example, there has not been sufficient scientific research into the particular nutritional requirements for infants. Consequently, all of the DRI values for infants are AIs derived from nutrient values in human breast milk. For older babies and children, AI values are derived from human milk coupled with data on adults. The AI is meant for a healthy target group and is not meant to be sufficient for certain at-risk groups, such as premature infants.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Tolerable Upper Intake Levels.</strong> The UL was established to help distinguish healthful and harmful nutrient intakes. Developed in part as a response to the growing usage of dietary supplements, ULs indicate the highest level of continuous intake of a particular nutrient that may be taken without causing health problems. When a nutrient does not have any known issue if taken in excessive doses, it is not assigned a UL. However, even when a nutrient does not have a UL it is not necessarily safe to consume in large amounts.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges.</strong> The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR)</a><span class="glossdef">The value of the energy-yielding nutrients carbohydrates, protein, and fat, expressed as percentages of total daily calorie intake, sufficient to provide total adequate energy needs; staying within the AMDR is associated with reducing the risks for developing chronic disease.</span></span> is the calculated range of how much energy from carbohydrates, fats, and protein is recommended for a healthy diet.

Keep in mind when evaluating your nutritional intake that the values established have been devised with an ample safety margin and should be used as guidance for optimal intakes. Also, the values are meant to assess and plan average intake over time; that is, you don’t need to meet these recommendations every single day—meeting them on average over several days is sufficient.</p>

Because the serving sizes are included on the label, you can see how much of each nutrient is in each serving to make the comparisons. Knowing how to read the label is important because of the way some foods are presented. For example, a bag of peanuts at the grocery store may seem like a healthy snack to eat on the way to class. But have a look at that label. Does it contain one serving, or multiple servings? Unless you are buying the individual serving packages, chances are the bag you picked up is at least eight servings, if not more.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reading the Label</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_p01">The first part of the Nutrition Facts panel gives you information on the serving size and how many servings are in the container. For example, a label on a box of crackers might tell you that twenty crackers equals one serving and that the whole box contains 10 servings. All other values listed thereafter, from the calories to the dietary fiber, are based on this one serving. On the panel, the serving size is followed by the number of calories and then a list of selected nutrients. You will also see “Percent Daily Value” on the far right-hand side. This helps you determine if the food is a good source of a particular nutrient or not. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Daily Value (DV)</a><span class="glossdef">Based upon the RDI of a specific nutrient in a 2,000 kilocalorie diet.</span></span> represents the recommended amount of a given nutrient based on the RDI of that nutrient in a 2,000-kilocalorie diet (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_f03">Figure 2.2 "Determining Your Nutrient Allowances per Day"</a>). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">percentage of Daily Value (percent DV)</a><span class="glossdef">The percentage of the amount of the nutrient in relationship to the DV. They are applicable only for a 2,000-calorie daily diet (not 2,500 calories).</span></span> represents the proportion of the total daily recommended amount that you will get from one serving of the food. For example, in the food label in <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_f03">Figure 2.2 "Determining Your Nutrient Allowances per Day"</a>, the percent DV of calcium for one serving of macaroni-and-cheese is 20 percent, which means that one serving of macaroni and cheese provides 20 percent of the daily recommended calcium intake. Since the DV for calcium is 1,000 milligrams, the food producer determined the <em class="emphasis">percent</em> DV for calcium by taking the calcium content in milligrams in each serving, and dividing it by 1,000 milligrams, and then multiplying it by 100 to get it into percentage format. Whether you consume 2,000 calories per day or not you can still use the percent DV as a target reference.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_p02">Generally, a percent DV of 5 is considered low and a percent DV of 20 is considered high. This means, as a general rule, for fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium, look for foods with a low percent DV. Alternatively, when concentrating on essential mineral or vitamin intake, look for a high percent DV. To figure out your fat allowance remaining for the day after consuming one serving of macaroni-and-cheese, look at the percent DV for fat, which is 18 percent, and subtract it from 100 percent. To know this amount in grams of fat, read the footnote of the food label to find that the recommended maximum amount of fat grams to consume per day for a 2,000 kilocalories per day diet is 65 grams. Eighteen percent of sixty-five equals about 12 grams. This means that 53 grams of fat are remaining in your fat allowance. Remember, to have a healthy diet the recommendation is to eat less than this amount of fat grams per day, especially if you want to lose weight.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_s02_p01">Often we hear news of a particular nutrient or food product that contributes to our health or may prevent disease. A health claim is a statement that links a particular food with a reduced risk of developing disease. As such, health claims such as “reduces heart disease,” must be evaluated by the FDA before it may appear on packaging. Prior to the passage of the NLEA products that made such claims were categorized as drugs and not food. All health claims must be substantiated by scientific evidence in order for it to be approved and put on a food label. To avoid having companies making false claims, laws also regulate how health claims are presented on food packaging. In addition to the claim being backed up by scientific evidence, it may never claim to cure or treat the disease.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_s05_p01">Food manufacturers are required by the FDA to list on their packages if the product contains any of the eight most common ingredients that cause food allergies. These eight common allergens are as follows: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat. (More information on these allergens will be discussed in <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch11#zimmerman_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Energy Balance and Body Weight"</a>.) The FDA does not require warnings that cross contamination may occur during packaging, however most manufacturers include this advisory as a courtesy. For instance, you may notice a label that states, “This product is manufactured in a factory that also processes peanuts.” If you have food allergies, it is best to avoid products that may have been contaminated with the allergen.</p>

                    <li>The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act made it a law that foods sold in the United States have a food label that provides the accurate contents of nutrients within them. Canada has a similar law.</li>

                    <li>To keep companies from making false claims, the FDA provides regulation for food manufacturers in putting labels on packages that promote health. Allergens must also be listed on food labels. Sometimes cross contamination does occur during packaging. Most food manufacturers voluntarily list this information. If you have a food allergy, it is best to avoid any product that has even had the possibility of coming in contact with a known allergen.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s08_s01_p01">Have you ever heard the expression, “Your eyes were bigger than your stomach?” This means that you thought you wanted a lot more food than you could actually eat. Amounts of food can be deceiving to the eye, especially if you have nothing to compare them to. It is very easy to heap a pile of mashed potatoes on your plate, particularly if it is a big plate, and not realize that you have just helped yourself to three portions instead of one.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s08_s01_p02">The food industry makes following the <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines</em> a challenge. In many restaurants and eating establishments, portion sizes have increased, use of SoFAS has increased, and consequently the typical meal contains more calories than it used to. In addition, our sedentary lives make it difficult to expend enough calories during normal daily activities. In fact, more than one-third of adults are not physically active at all.</p>

An <em class="emphasis">intelligent</em> person knows which half to believe.” In this age of information where instant Internet access is just a click away, it is easy to be misled if you do not know where to go for reliable nutrition information. There are a few websites that can be consistently relied upon for accurate material that is updated regularly.</p>
    <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s09_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Eyes of Discernment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s09_s01_p01">“New study shows that margarine contributes to arterial plaque.” “Asian study reveals that two cups of coffee per day can have detrimental effects on the nervous system.” How do you react when you read news of this nature? Do you boycott margarine and coffee? When reading nutrition-related claims, articles, websites, or advertisements always remember that one study does not substantiate a fact. One study neither proves nor disproves anything. Readers who may be looking for complex answers to nutritional dilemmas can quickly misconstrue such statements and be led down a path of misinformation. Listed below are ways that you can develop discerning eyes when reading nutritional news.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s09_s01_l01">
            <li>The scientific study under discussion should be published in a peer-reviewed journal, such as the <em class="emphasis">Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition</em>. Question studies that come from less trustworthy sources (such as non peer-reviewed journals or websites) or that are not published.</li>
            <li>The report should disclose the methods used by the researcher(s). Did the study last for three or thirty weeks? Were there ten or one hundred participants? What did the participants actually do? Did the researcher(s) observe the results themselves or did they rely on self reports from program participants?</li>
            <li>Who were the subjects of this study? Humans or animals? If human, are any traits/characteristics noted? You may realize you have more in common with certain program participants and can use that as a basis to gauge if the study applies to you.</li>
            <li>Credible reports often disseminate new findings in the context of previous research. A single study on its own gives you very limited information, but if a body of literature supports a finding, it gives you more confidence in it.</li>
            <li>Peer-reviewed articles deliver a broad perspective and are inclusive of findings of many studies on the exact same subject.</li>
            <li>When reading such news, ask yourself, “Is this making sense?” Even if coffee does adversely affect the nervous system, do you drink enough of it to see any negative effects? Remember, if a headline professes a new remedy for a nutrition-related topic, it may well be a research-supported piece of news, but more often than not it is a sensational story designed to catch the attention of an unsuspecting consumer. Track down the original journal article to see if it really supports the conclusions being drawn in the news report.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s09_s01_p02">When reading information on websites, remember the following criteria for discerning if the site is valid:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s09_s01_l02">
            <li>Who sponsors the website?</li>
            <li>Are names and credentials disclosed?</li>
            <li>Is an editorial board identified?</li>
            <li>Does the site contain links to other credible informational websites? Even better, does it reference peer-reviewed journal articles? If so, do those journal articles actually back up the claims being made on the website?</li>
            <li>How often is the website updated?</li>
            <li>Are you being sold something at this website?</li>
