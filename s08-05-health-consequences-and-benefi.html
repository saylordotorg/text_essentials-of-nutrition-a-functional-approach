Added sugars do not include sugars that occur naturally in whole foods (such as an apple), but do include natural sugars such as brown sugar, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, fruit juice concentrates, maple syrup, sucrose, and raw sugar that are then added to create other foods (such as cookies). Currently, nutrition labels do not distinguish between added and naturally occurring sugars and give only the total sugar content, making it difficult for consumers to determine their consumption of added sugars. Results from a survey of forty-two thousand Americans reports that in 2008 the average intake of added sugars is 15 percent of total calories, a drop from 18 percent of total calories in 2000.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn04_013">Welsh J.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Obesity, Diabetes, and Heart Disease and Their Hypothesized Link to Excessive Sugar and Refined Carbohydrate Consumption</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p01">To understand the magnitude of the health problem in the United States consider this—in the United States approximately 130 million adults are overweight, and 30 percent of them are considered obese. The obesity epidemic has reached young adults and children and will markedly affect the prevalence of serious health consequences in adulthood. Health consequences linked to being overweight or obese include Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, depression, and some cancers. An infatuation with sugary foods and refined grains likely contributes to the epidemic proportion of people who are overweight or obese in this country, but so do the consumption of high-calorie foods that contain too much saturated fat and the sedentary lifestyle of most Americans. There is much disagreement over whether high-carbohydrate diets increase weight-gain and disease risk, especially when calories are not significantly higher between compared diets. Many scientific studies demonstrate positive correlations between diets high in added sugars with weight gain and disease risk, but some others do not show a significant relationship. In regard to refined grains, there are no studies that show consumption of refined grains increases weight gain or disease risk. What is clear, however, is that getting more of your carbohydrates from dietary sources containing whole grains instead of refined grains stimulates weight loss and reduces disease risk.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p02">A major source of added sugars in the American diet is soft drinks. There is consistent scientific evidence that consuming sugary soft drinks increases weight gain and disease risk. An analysis of over thirty studies in the <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> concluded that there is much evidence to indicate higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is linked with weight gain and obesity.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn04_014">Malik, V.

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Most Notorious Sugar</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p01">Before high-fructose corn syrup (HCFS) was marketed as the best food and beverage sweetener, sucrose (table sugar) was the number-one sweetener in America. (Recall that sucrose, or table sugar, is a disaccharide consisting of one glucose unit and one fructose unit.) HFCS also contains the simple sugars fructose and glucose, but with fructose at a slightly higher concentration. In the production of HFCS, corn starch is broken down to glucose and fructose, and some of the glucose is then converted to fructose. Fructose is sweeter than glucose; hence many food manufacturers choose to sweeten foods with HFCS. HFCS is used as a sweetener for carbonated beverages, condiments, cereals, and a great variety of other processed foods.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p02">Some scientists, public health personnel, and healthcare providers believe that fructose is the cause of the obesity epidemic and its associated health consequences. The majority of their evidence stems from the observation that since the early 1970s the number of overweight or obese Americans has dramatically increased and so has the consumption of foods containing HFCS. However, as discussed, so has the consumption of added sugars in general. Animal studies that fuel the fructose opponents show fructose is not used to produce energy in the body; instead it is mostly converted to fat in the liver—potentially contributing to insulin resistance and the development of Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, fructose does not stimulate the release of certain appetite-suppressing hormones, like insulin, as glucose does. Thus, a diet high in fructose could potentially stimulate fat deposition and weight gain.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p03">In human studies, excessive fructose intake has sometimes been associated with weight gain, but results are inconsistent. Moderate fructose intake is not associated with weight gain at all. Moreover, other studies show that some fructose in the diet actually improves glucose metabolism especially in people with Type 2 diabetes.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn04_017">Elliott, S. S. et al. “Fructose, Weight Gain, and the Insulin Resistance Syndrome.” <em class="emphasis">Am J Clin Nutr</em> 76, no. 5 (2002): 911–22. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/76/5/911.full">http://www.ajcn.org/content/76/5/911.full</a>.</span> In fact, people with diabetes were once advised to use fructose as an alternative sweetener to table sugar. Overall, there is no good evidence that moderate fructose consumption contributes to weight gain and chronic disease. At this time conclusive evidence is not available on whether fructose is any worse than any other added sugar in increasing the risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p01">Oral health refers not only to healthy teeth and gums, but also to the health of all the supporting tissues in the mouth such as ligaments, nerves, jawbone, chewing muscles, and salivary glands. Over ten years ago the Surgeon General produced its first report dedicated to oral health, stating that oral health and health in general are not separate entities.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn04_018">Surgeon General. “National Call to Action to Promote Oral Health.” Accessed September 30, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calls/oralhealth/nationalcalltoaction.html">http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calls/oralhealth/nationalcalltoaction.html</a>.</span> Instead, oral health is an integral part of overall health and well-being.

(Fermentable sugars are those that are easily metabolized by bacteria in a process known as fermentation. Glucose, fructose, and maltose are three examples.) Bacteria that inhabit the mouth metabolize fermentable sugars and starches in refined grains to acids that erode tooth enamel and deeper bone tissues. The acid creates holes (cavities) in the teeth that can be extremely painful (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_f01">Figure 4.10 "Gingivitis"</a>). Gums are also damaged by bacteria produced by acids, leading to gingivitis (characterized by inflamed and bleeding gums). Saliva is actually a natural mouthwash that neutralizes the acids and aids in building up teeth that have been damaged.</p>

The most famous of these low-carbohydrate diets is the Atkin’s diet. Others include the “South Beach” diet, the “Zone” diet, and the “Earth” diet. Despite the claims these diets make, there is little scientific evidence to support that low-carbohydrate diets are significantly better than other diets in promoting long-term weight loss.

The bacterial breakdown of fiber in the large intestine releases short-chain fatty acids. These molecules have been found to nourish colonic cells, inhibit colonic inflammation, and stimulate the immune system (thereby providing protection of the colon from harmful substances). Additionally, the bacterial indigestible fiber, mostly insoluble, increases stool bulk and softness increasing transit time in the large intestine and facilitating feces elimination. One phenomenon of consuming foods high in fiber is increased gas, since the byproducts of bacterial digestion of fiber are gases.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s05_s05_p03">Some studies have found a link between high dietary-fiber intake and a decreased risk for colon cancer. However an analysis of several studies, published in the <em class="emphasis">Journal of the American Medical Association</em> in 2005, did not find that dietary-fiber intake was associated with a reduction in colon cancer risk.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn04_028">Park, Y. et al. “Dietary Fiber Intake and Risk of Colorectal Cancer.” <em class="emphasis">JAMA</em> 294, no. 22 (2005): 2849–57. doi: 10.1001/jama.294.22.2849.</span> There is some evidence that specific fiber types (such as inulin) may protect against colon cancer, but more studies are needed to conclusively determine how certain fiber types (and at what dose) inhibit colon cancer development.</p>
