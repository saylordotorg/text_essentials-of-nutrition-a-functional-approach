        <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s00_p01">Good nutritional choices reduce the risk of chronic disease during the middle-aged years.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s00_p02">One hundred years ago, when many families sat down to dinner, they might have eaten boiled potatoes or corn, leafy vegetables such as cabbage or collards, fresh-baked bread, and, if they were fortunate, a small amount of beef or chicken. Young and old alike benefitted from a sound diet that packed a real nutritional punch. Times have changed. Many families today fill their dinner plates with fatty foods, such as french fries cooked in vegetable oil, a hamburger that contains several ounces of ground beef, and a white-bread bun, with a single piece of lettuce and a slice or two of tomato as the only vegetables served with the meal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s00_p03">Our diet has changed drastically as processed foods, which did not exist a century ago, and animal-based foods now account for a large percentage of our calories. Not only has what we eat changed, but the amount of it that we consume has greatly increased as well, as plates and portion size have grown much larger. All of these choices impact our health, with short- and long-term consequences as we age. Possible effects in the short-term include excess weight gain and constipation. The possible long-term effects, primarily related to obesity, include the risk of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, osteoarthritis, sleep apenea, respiratory problems, liver and gallbladder disease, and certain cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon) among middle-aged and elderly adults.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_001">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Overweight and Obesity: Health Consequences.” Last updated March 3, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/causes/health.html">http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/causes/health.html</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s00_p04">It is best to start making healthy choices from a young age and maintain them as you mature. However, a recent report published in the <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em>, suggests that adopting good nutritional choices later in life, during the forties, fifties, and even the sixties, may still help to reduce the risk of chronic disease as you grow older.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_002">Rivlin, R. S. “Keeping the Young-Elderly Healthy: Is It Too Late to Improve Our Health through Nutrition?” <em class="emphasis">Am J Clin Nutr</em> 86, supplement (2007): 1572S–6S.</span> Even if past nutritional and lifestyle choices were not aligned with dietary guidelines, older adults can still do a great deal to reduce their risk of disability and chronic disease. As we age, we tend to lose lean body mass. This loss of muscle and bone can have critical health implications. For example, a decrease in body strength can result in an increased risk for fractures because older adults with weakened muscles are more likely to fall, and to sustain serious injuries when they do. However, improving your diet while increasing physical activity helps to control weight, reduce fat mass, and maintain muscle and bone mass.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s00_p05">There are a number of changes middle-aged adults can implement, even after years of unhealthy choices. Choices include eating more dark, green, leafy vegetables, substituting high-fat proteins with lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and nuts, and engaging in moderate physical activity for thirty minutes per day, several days per week. The resulting improvements in body composition will go a long way toward providing greater protection against falls and fractures, and helping to ward off cardiovascular disease and hypertension, among other chronic conditions.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_003">Rivlin, R. S. “Keeping the Young-Elderly Healthy: Is It Too Late to Improve Our Health through Nutrition?” <em class="emphasis">Am J Clin Nutr</em> 86, supplement (2007): 1572S–6S.</span></p>

        </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_p01">As discussed in <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch12#zimmerman_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Nutrition through the Life Cycle: From Pregnancy to the Toddler Years"</a>, all people need the same basic nutrients—essential amino acids, carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, and twenty-eight vitamins and minerals—to maintain life and health. However, the amounts of needed nutrients change as we pass from one stage of the human life cycle to the next. Young children require a higher caloric intake relative to body size to facilitate physical and mental development. On the other hand, inactive senior citizens need fewer calories than other adults to maintain their weight and stay healthy. Psychological, emotional, and social issues over the span of a human life can also influence diet and nutrition. For example, peer pressure during adolescence can greatly affect the nutritional choices a teenager makes. Therefore, it is important to weigh a number of considerations when examining how nutrient needs change. In this chapter, we will focus on diet, nutrition, and the human life cycle from the remainder of childhood into the elderly years.</p>
    <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Changes during Childhood</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p01">Early childhood encompasses infancy and the toddler years, from birth through age three. The remaining part of childhood is the period from ages four through eight and is the time when children enter school. A number of critical physiological and emotional changes take place during this life stage. For example, a child’s limbs lengthen steadily, while the growth of other body parts begins to slow down. By age ten, the skull and the brain have grown to near-adult size.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_004">Beverly McMillan, <em class="emphasis">Human Body: A Visual Guide</em> (Sydney, Australia: Weldon Owen, 2006), 258.</span> Emotional and psychological changes occur as well. Children’s attitudes and opinions about food deepen. They not only begin taking their cues about food preferences from family members, but also from peers and the larger culture. All of these factors should impact the nutritional choices parents make for their children. This time in a child’s life provides an opportunity for parents and other caregivers to reinforce good eating habits and to introduce new foods into the diet, while remaining mindful of a child’s preferences. Parents should also serve as role models for their children, who will often mimic their behavior and eating habits.</p>

    <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Changes during Puberty</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_s02_p01">The onset of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">puberty</a><span class="glossdef">The period of the human life cycle between ages nine to thirteen, nutritionally speaking.</span></span> is the beginning of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">adolescence</a><span class="glossdef">The period of the human life cycle between ages fourteen to eighteen, nutritionally speaking.</span></span>, and is the bridge between the childhood years and young adulthood. Medically, adolescence is defined as the period between ages eleven and fourteen for girls and between twelve to fifteen for boys. For the purpose of discussing the influence of nutritional choices during the life cycle, this text will follow the <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em>, which divides the adolescent years into two stages: ages nine to thirteen, or puberty, and ages fourteen to eighteen, or late adolescence. We will discuss puberty first. Some of the important physiological changes that take place during this stage include the development of primary sex characteristics, or the reproductive organs, along with the onset of menstruation in females. This life stage is also characterized by the appearance of secondary sex characteristics, such as the growth of facial and body hair, the development of breasts in girls, and the deepening of the voice in boys. Other physical changes include rapid growth and alterations in body proportions.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_005">Elaine U. Polan, RNC, MS and Daphne R. Taylor, RN, MS, <em class="emphasis">Journey Across the Life Span: Human Development and Health Promotion</em> (Philadelphia: F. A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_s03_p01">The <em class="emphasis">Dietary Guidelines</em> defines the next phase of the human life cycle, late adolescence, as the period from ages fourteen to eighteen. After puberty, the rate of physical growth slows down. Girls stop growing taller around age sixteen, while boys continue to grow taller until ages eighteen to twenty. One of the psychological and emotional changes that takes place during this life stage includes the desire for independence as adolescents develop individual identities apart from their families.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_006">Elaine U. Polan, RNC, MS and Daphne R. Taylor, RN, MS, <em class="emphasis">Journey Across the Life Span: Human Development and Health Promotion</em> (Philadelphia: F. A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_s04_p01">The next phase, young adulthood, is the period from ages nineteen to thirty. It is a stable time compared to childhood and adolescence. Physical growth has been completed and all of the organs and body systems are fully developed. Typically, a young adult who is active has reached his or her physical peak and is in prime health. For example, vital capacity, or the maximum amount of air that the lungs can inhale and exhale, is at its peak between the ages of twenty and forty.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_007">Elaine U. Polan, RNC, MS and Daphne R. Taylor, RN, MS, <em class="emphasis">Journey Across the Life Span: Human Development and Health Promotion</em> (Philadelphia: F. A.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Changes in Middle Age</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_s05_p01">Nutritionally speaking, middle age is defined as the period from age thirty-one to fifty. The early period of this stage is very different from the end. For example, during the early years of middle age, many women experience pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation. In the latter part of this life stage, women face perimenopause, which is a transition period that leads up to menopause, or the end of menstruation. A number of physical changes take place in the middle-aged years, including the loss of bone mass in women due to dropping levels of estrogen during menopause. In both men and women, visual acuity declines, and by age forty there can be a decreased ability to see objects at a close distance, a condition known as presbyopia.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_008">Elaine U. Polan, RNC, MS and Daphne R. Taylor, RN, MS, <em class="emphasis">Journey Across the Life Span: Human Development and Health Promotion</em> (Philadelphia: F. A. Davis Company, 2003), 192–93.</span> All of these are signs of aging, as the human body begins to change in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. However, a middle aged person can remain vital, healthy, and near his or her physical peak with proper diet and adequate exercise.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Changes in the Older Adult Years</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_s06_p01">The senior, or elderly, years are the period from age fifty-one until the end of life. A number of physiological and emotional changes take place during this life stage. For example, many elderly adults face serious health challenges, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or dementia. Both men and women experience a loss of muscle mass and strength and undergo changes in body composition. Fat deposits build up in the abdominal area, which increases the risk for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The skin becomes thinner and may take longer to heal after an injury. Around age seventy, men begin to experience bone loss when estrogen and testosterone levels begin to decline.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_009">American Medical Association, <em class="emphasis">Complete Guide to Prevention and Wellness</em> (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2008), 512.</span> Healthy nutritional choices can help to prevent or manage disability and chronic conditions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_s06_p02">In addition, disorders of the nervous system can have profound effects. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Dementia</a><span class="glossdef">A disorder of the nervous system characterized by changes in the normal activity of the brain.</span></span> is the umbrella term for changes in the normal activity of the brain. Elderly adults who suffer from dementia may experience memory loss, agitation, and delusions. One in eight people over age sixty-four and almost half of all people over eighty-five suffer from the brain disorder Alzheimer’s disease, which is the most common form of dementia.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_010">American Medical Association, <em class="emphasis">Complete Guide to Prevention and Wellness</em> (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2008), 421.</span> Neurological disorder and psychological conditions, such as depression, can influence attitudes toward food, along with the ability to prepare or ingest food. They might lead some adults to overindulge to compensate for stress or emotions that are difficult to handle. Other adults might eat less or pay less attention to their diet and nutritional needs. Elderly adults may also need guidance from dietitians and health-care professionals to make the best dietary choices for this stage of life.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Changing Needs and Nutrition</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s01_s07_p01">Nutritional needs continue to change at each stage of life. It is important to adjust your diet and physical activity to meet these changing needs and ensure health and wellness throughout your life. Parents must continue to help their school-aged children and adolescents establish healthy eating habits and attitudes toward food. Their primary role is to bring a wide variety of health-promoting foods into the home, so that their children can make good choices. As children become adults, they must be mindful of the choices they make and how those choices affect their health, not only in the present but also in the future.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_p01">Nutritional needs change as children leave the toddler years. From ages four to eight, school-aged children grow consistently, but at a slower rate than infants and toddlers. They also experience the loss of deciduous, or “baby,” teeth and the arrival of permanent teeth, which typically begins at age six or seven. As new teeth come in, many children have some malocclusion, or malposition, of their teeth, which can affect their ability to chew food. Other changes that affect nutrition include the influence of peers on dietary choices and the kinds of foods offered by schools and afterschool programs, which can make up a sizable part of a child’s diet. Food-related problems for young children can include tooth decay, food sensitivities, and malnourishment. Also, excessive weight gain early in life can lead to obesity into adolescence and adulthood.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Childhood (Ages Four to Eight): “Growing Pains”</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p01">At this life stage, a healthy diet facilitates physical and mental development and helps to maintain health and wellness. School-aged children experience steady, consistent growth, with an average growth rate of 2–3 inches (5–7 centimeters) in height and 4.5–6.5 pounds (2–3 kilograms) in weight per year. In addition, the rate of growth for the extremities is faster than for the trunk, which results in more adult-like proportions. Long-bone growth stretches muscles and ligaments, which results in many children experiencing “growing pains,” at nighttime in particular.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_011">Elaine U. Polan, RNC, MS and Daphne R. Taylor, RN, MS, <em class="emphasis">Journey Across the Life Span: Human Development and Health Promotion</em> (Philadelphia: F. A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p01">Children’s energy needs vary, depending on their growth and level of physical activity. Energy requirements also vary according to gender. Girls ages four to eight require 1,200 to 1,800 calories a day, while boys need 1,200 to 2,000 calories daily, and, depending on their activity level, maybe more. Also, recommended intakes of macronutrients and most micronutrients are higher relative to body size, compared with nutrient needs during adulthood. Therefore, children should be provided nutrient-dense food at meal- and snack-time. However, it is important not to overfeed children, as this can lead to childhood obesity, which is discussed in the next section. Parents and other caregivers can turn to the MyPlate website for guidance: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/">http://www.choosemyplate.gov/</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s02_p01">For carbohydrates, the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) is 45–65 percent of daily calories (which is a recommended daily allowance of 135–195 grams for 1,200 daily calories). Carbohydrates high in fiber should make up the bulk of intake. The AMDR for protein is 10–30 percent of daily calories (30–90 grams for 1,200 daily calories). Children have a high need for protein to support muscle growth and development. High levels of essential fatty acids are needed to support growth (although not as high as in infancy and the toddler years). As a result, the AMDR for fat is 25–35 percent of daily calories (33–47 grams for 1,200 daily calories). Children should get 17–25 grams of fiber per day.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s03_p01">Micronutrient needs should be met with foods first. Parents and caregivers should select a variety of foods from each food group to ensure that nutritional requirements are met. Because children grow rapidly, they require foods that are high in iron, such as lean meats, legumes, fish, poultry, and iron-enriched cereals. Adequate fluoride is crucial to support strong teeth. One of the most important micronutrient requirements during childhood is adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. Both are needed to build dense bones and a strong skeleton. Children who do not consume adequate vitamin D should be given a supplement of 10 micrograms (400 international units) per day. <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_s03_t01">Table 13.1 "Micronutrient Levels during Childhood"</a> shows the micronutrient recommendations for school-aged children. (Note that the recommendations are the same for boys and girls. As we progress through the different stages of the human life cycle, there will be some differences between males and females regarding micronutrient needs.)</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Factors Influencing Intake</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p01">A number of factors can influence children’s eating habits and attitudes toward food. Family environment, societal trends, taste preferences, and messages in the media all impact the emotions that children develop in relation to their diet. Television commercials can entice children to consume sugary products, fatty fast-foods, excess calories, refined ingredients, and sodium. Therefore, it is critical that parents and caregivers direct children toward healthy choices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p02">One way to encourage children to eat healthy foods is to make meal- and snack-time fun and interesting. Parents should include children in food planning and preparation, for example selecting items while grocery shopping or helping to prepare part of a meal, such as making a salad. At this time, parents can also educate children about kitchen safety. It might be helpful to cut sandwiches, meats, or pancakes into small or interesting shapes. In addition, parents should offer nutritious desserts, such as fresh fruits, instead of calorie-laden cookies, cakes, salty snacks, and ice cream. Also, studies show that children who eat family meals on a frequent basis consume more nutritious foods.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_012">Dakota County, Minnesota. “Research on the Benefits of Family Meals.” © 2006.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_p01">Malnutrition is a problem many children face, in both developing nations and the developed world. Even with the wealth of food in North America, many children grow up malnourished, or even hungry. The US Census Bureau characterizes households into the following groups:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>food secure</li>

            <li>food insecure with moderate hunger</li>
            <li>food insecure with severe hunger</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_p02">Millions of children grow up in food-insecure households with inadequate diets due to both the amount of available food and the quality of food. In the United States, about 20 percent of households with children are food insecure to some degree. In half of those, only adults experience food insecurity, while in the other half both adults and children are considered to be food insecure, which means that children did not have access to adequate, nutritious meals at times.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_013">Coleman-Jensen, A. et al. “Household Food Security in the United States in 2010.” US Department of Agriculture, <em class="emphasis">Economic Research Report</em>, no.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_p03">Growing up in a food-insecure household can lead to a number of problems. Deficiencies in iron, zinc, protein, and vitamin A can result in stunted growth, illness, and limited development. Federal programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program, and Summer Feeding Programs, work to address the risk of hunger and malnutrition in school-aged children. They help to fill the gaps and provide children living in food-insecure households with greater access to nutritious meals.

            <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_p04">Beginning with preschool, children consume at least one of their meals in a school setting. Many children receive both breakfast and lunch outside of the home. Therefore, it is important for schools to provide meals that are nutritionally sound. In the United States, more than thirty-one million children from low-income families are given meals provided by the National School Lunch Program. This federally-funded program offers low-cost or free lunches to schools, and also snacks to afterschool facilities. School districts that take part receive subsidies from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for every meal they serve. School lunches must meet the <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em> and need to provide one-third of the RDAs for protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, and calcium.

This remains an issue for school-aged children. Recent studies show that three million children under age eighteen are allergic to at least one type of food.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_016">American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. “Allergy Statistics.” Accessed on March 5, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aaaai.org/about-the-aaaai/newsroom/allergy-statistics.aspx">http://www.aaaai.org/about-the-aaaai/newsroom/allergy-statistics.aspx</a>.</span> Some of the most common allergenic foods include peanuts, milk, eggs, soy, wheat, and shellfish. An allergy occurs when a protein in food triggers an immune response, which results in the release of antibodies, histamine, and other defenders that attack foreign bodies. Possible symptoms include itchy skin, hives, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. Symptoms usually develop within minutes to hours after consuming a food allergen. Children can outgrow a food allergy, especially allergies to wheat, milk, eggs, or soy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s05_p03">Some children experience a food intolerance, which does not involve an immune response. A food intolerance is marked by unpleasant symptoms that occur after consuming certain foods. Lactose intolerance, though rare in very young children, is one example. Children who suffer from this condition experience an adverse reaction to the lactose in milk products. It is a result of the small intestine’s inability to produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which is produced by the small intestine. Symptoms of lactose intolerance usually affect the GI tract and can include bloating, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, and diarrhea. An intolerance is best managed by making dietary changes and avoiding any foods that trigger the reaction.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_018">National Digestive Disease Information Clearinghouse, a service of National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health. “Lactose Intolerance.” <em class="emphasis">NIH Publication No. 09–2751</em> (June 2009).

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Threat of Lead Toxicity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s06_p01">There is a danger of lead toxicity, or lead poisoning, among school-aged children. Lead is found in plumbing in old homes, in lead-based paint, and occasionally in the soil. Contaminated food and water can increase exposure and result in hazardous lead levels in the blood. Children under age six are especially vulnerable. They may consume items tainted with lead, such as chipped, lead-based paint. Another common exposure is lead dust in carpets, with the dust flaking off of paint on walls. When children play or roll around on carpets coated with lead, they are in jeopardy. Lead is indestructible, and once it has been ingested it is difficult for the human body to alter or remove it. It can quietly build up in the body for months, or even years, before the onset of symptoms. Lead toxicity can damage the brain and central nervous system, resulting in impaired thinking, reasoning, and perception.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s02_s06_p02">Treatment for lead poisoning includes removing the child from the source of contamination and extracting lead from the body. Extraction may involve chelation therapy, which binds with lead so it can be excreted in urine. Another treatment protocol, EDTA therapy, involves administering a drug called ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to remove lead from the bloodstream of patients with levels greater than 45 mcg/dL.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_019">Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. “Lead poisoning.” ©1998–2012 Accessed March 5, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/lead-poisoning/FL00068">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/lead-poisoning/FL00068</a>.</span> Fortunately, lead toxicity is highly preventable. It involves identifying potential hazards, such as lead paint and pipes, and removing them before children are exposed to them.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_p01">Puberty is the beginning of adolescence. The onset of puberty brings a number of changes, including the development of primary and secondary sex characteristics, growth spurts, an increase in body fat, and an increase in bone and muscle development. All of these changes must be supported with adequate intake and healthy food choices.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Onset of Puberty (Ages Nine to Thirteen)</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p01">This period of physical development is divided into two phases. The first phase involves height increases from 20 to 25 percent. Puberty is second to the prenatal period in terms of rapid growth as the long bones stretch to their final, adult size. Girls grow 2–8 inches (5–20 centimeters) taller, while boys grow 4–12 inches (10–30 centimeters) taller. The second phase involves weight gain related to the development of bone, muscle, and fat tissue. Also in the midst of puberty, the sex hormones trigger the development of reproductive organs and secondary sexual characteristics, such as pubic hair. Girls also develop “curves,” while boys become broader and more muscular.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_020">Beverly McMillan, <em class="emphasis">Illustrated Atlas of the Human Body</em> (Sydney, Australia: Weldon Owen, 2008), 258.</span></p>

For ages nine to thirteen, girls should consume about 1,400 to 2,200 calories per day and boys should consume 1,600 to 2,600 calories per day. Physically active preteens who regularly participate in sports or exercise need to eat a greater number of calories to account for increased energy expenditures.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_s02_p01">For carbohydrates, the AMDR is 45 to 65 percent of daily calories (which is a recommended daily allowance of 158–228 grams for 1,400–1,600 daily calories). Carbohydrates that are high in fiber should make up the bulk of intake. The AMDR for protein is 10 to 30 percent of daily calories (35–105 grams for 1,400 daily calories for girls and 40–120 grams for 1,600 daily calories for boys). The AMDR for fat is 25 to 35 percent of daily calories (39–54 grams for 1,400 daily calories for girls and 44–62 grams for 1,600 daily calories for boys), depending on caloric intake and activity level.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Childhood Obesity</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p01">Children need adequate caloric intake for growth, and it is important not to impose very restrictive diets. However, exceeding caloric requirements on a regular basis can lead to childhood obesity, which has become a major problem in North America. Nearly one of three US children and adolescents are overweight or obese.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_021">Let’s Move. “Learn the Facts.” Accessed March 5, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.letsmove.gov/learn-facts/epidemic-childhood-obesity">http://www.letsmove.gov/learn-facts/epidemic-childhood-obesity</a>.</span> In Canada, approximately 26 percent of children and adolescents are overweight or obese.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_022">Childhood Obesity Foundation. “Statistics.” Accessed March 5, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/statistics">http://www.childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/statistics</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p02">There are a number of reasons behind this problem, including:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>larger portion sizes</li>
            <li>limited access to nutrient-rich foods</li>
            <li>increased access to fast foods and vending machines</li>
            <li>lack of breastfeeding support</li>
            <li>declining physical education programs in schools</li>
            <li>insufficient physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle</li>
            <li>media messages encouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p03">Children who suffer from obesity are more likely to become overweight or obese adults. Obesity has a profound effect on self-esteem, energy, and activity level. Even more importantly, it is a major risk factor for a number of diseases later in life, including cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and certain cancers.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_023">World Health Organization. “Obesity and Overweight Fact Sheet.” Last revised March 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p04">A percentile for body mass index (BMI) specific to age and sex is used to determine if a child is overweight or obese. This is more appropriate than the BMI categories used for adults because the body composition of children varies as they develop, and differs between boys and girls. If a child gains weight inappropriate to growth, parents and caregivers should limit energy-dense, nutrient-poor snack foods. Also, children ages three and older can follow the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines of no more than 35 percent of calories from fat (10 percent or less from saturated fat), and no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day. In addition, it is extremely beneficial to increase a child’s physical activity and limit sedentary activities, such as watching television, playing video games, or surfing the Internet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p05">Programs to address childhood obesity can include behavior modification, exercise counseling, psychological support or therapy, family counseling, and family meal-planning advice. For most, the goal is not weight loss, but rather allowing height to catch up with weight as the child continues to grow. Rapid weight loss is not recommended for preteens or younger children due to the risk of deficiencies and stunted growth.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_s01_p01">One major contributing factor to childhood obesity is the consumption of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">added sugars</a><span class="glossdef">Sugars and other sweeteners (such as high-fructose corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, and molasses), that are added to food at the table, and are also ingredients in food products.</span></span>. Added sugars include not only sugar added to food at the table, but also are ingredients in items such as bread, cookies, cakes, pies, jams, and soft drinks. The added sugar in store-bought items may be listed as white sugar, brown sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, malt syrup, maple syrup, molasses, anhydrous dextrose, crystal dextrose, and concentrated fruit juice. (Not included are sugars that occur naturally in foods, such as the lactose in milk or the fructose in fruits.) In addition, sugars are often “hidden” in items added to foods after they’re prepared, such as ketchup, salad dressing, and other condiments. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, young children and adolescents consume an average of 322 calories per day from added sugars, or about 16 percent of daily calories.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_024">National Center for Health Statistics. “Consumption of Added Sugar among US Children and Adolescents, 2005–2008.” <em class="emphasis">NCHS Data Brief</em>, no. 87, (March 2012). <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db87.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db87.pdf</a>.</span> The primary offenders are processed and packaged foods, along with soda and other beverages. These foods are not only high in sugar, they are also light in terms of nutrients and often take the place of healthier options. Intake of added sugar should be limited to 100–150 calories per day to discourage poor eating habits.</p>

Preteens must be encouraged to lead more active lifestyles to prevent or treat childhood obesity. In the United States, the Let’s Move! campaign inspires kids to start exercising. This program, launched in 2010 by First Lady Michelle Obama, works to solve the problem of rising obesity rates among children, preteens, and teens. It offers information to parents and educators, works to provide healthier food choices in schools and afterschool programs, and helps children become more active. One way the program promotes physical activity is by encouraging preteens and teens to find something they love to do. When kids find an activity they enjoy, whether riding a bike, playing football, joining a soccer team, or participating in a dance crew, they are more likely to get moving and stay healthy.

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_p01">In this section, we will discuss the nutritional requirements for young people ages fourteen to eighteen. One way that teenagers assert their independence is by choosing what to eat. They have their own money to purchase food and tend to eat more meals away from home. Older adolescents also can be curious and open to new ideas, which includes trying new kinds of food and experimenting with their diet. For example, teens will sometimes skip a main meal and snack instead. That is not necessarily problematic. Their choice of food is more important than the time or place.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_p02">However, too many poor choices can make young people nutritionally vulnerable. Teens should be discouraged from eating fast food, which has a high fat and sugar content, or frequenting convenience stores and using vending machines, which typically offer poor nutritional selections. Other challenges that teens may face include obesity and eating disorders. At this life stage, young people still need guidance from parents and other caregivers about nutrition-related matters. It can be helpful to explain to young people how healthy eating habits can support activities they enjoy, such as skateboarding or dancing, or connect to their desires or interests, such as a lean figure, athletic performance, or improved cognition.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_s01_p01">As during puberty, growth and development during adolescence differs in males than in females. In teenage girls, fat assumes a larger percentage of body weight, while teenage boys experience greater muscle and bone increases. For both, primary and secondary sex characteristics have fully developed and the rate of growth slows with the end of puberty. Also, the motor functions of an older adolescent are comparable to those of an adult.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_026">Elaine U. Polan, RNC, MS and Daphne R. Taylor, RN, MS, <em class="emphasis">Journey Across the Life Span: Human Development and Health Promotion</em> (Philadelphia: F. A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_s01_s01_p01">Adolescents have increased appetites due to increased nutritional requirements. Nutrient needs are greater in adolescence than at any other time in the life cycle, except during pregnancy. The energy requirements for ages fourteen to eighteen are 1,800 to 2,400 calories for girls and 2,000 to 3,200 calories for boys, depending on activity level. The extra energy required for physical development during the teenaged years should be obtained from foods that provide nutrients instead of “empty calories.” Also, teens who participate in sports must make sure to meet their increased energy needs.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Macronutrients</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_s01_s02_p01">Older adolescents are more responsible for their dietary choices than younger children, but parents and caregivers must make sure that teens continue to meet their nutrient needs. For carbohydrates, the AMDR is 45 to 65 percent of daily calories (203–293 grams for 1,800 daily calories). Adolescents require more servings of grain than younger children, and should eat whole grains, such as wheat, oats, barley, and brown rice. The Institute of Medicine recommends higher intakes of protein for growth in the adolescent population. The AMDR for protein is 10 to 30 percent of daily calories (45–135 grams for 1,800 daily calories), and lean proteins, such as meat, poultry, fish, beans, nuts, and seeds are excellent ways to meet those nutritional needs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_s01_s02_p02">The AMDR for fat is 25 to 35 percent of daily calories (50–70 grams for 1,800 daily calories), and the AMDR for fiber is 25–34 grams per day, depending on daily calories and activity level. It is essential for young athletes and other physically active teens to intake enough fluids, because they are at a higher risk for becoming dehydrated.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_s01_s03_p01">Micronutrient recommendations for adolescents are mostly the same as for adults, though children this age need more of certain minerals to promote bone growth (e.g., calcium and phosphorus, along with iron and zinc for girls). Again, vitamins and minerals should be obtained from food first, with supplementation for certain micronutrients only (such as iron).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_s01_s03_p02">The most important micronutrients for adolescents are calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A, and iron. Adequate calcium and vitamin D are essential for building bone mass. The recommendation for calcium is 1,300 milligrams for both boys and girls. Low-fat milk and cheeses are excellent sources of calcium and help young people avoid saturated fat and cholesterol. It can also be helpful for adolescents to consume products fortified with calcium, such as breakfast cereals and orange juice. Iron supports the growth of muscle and lean body mass. Adolescent girls also need to ensure sufficient iron intake as they start to menstruate. Girls ages twelve to eighteen require 15 milligrams of iron per day. Increased amounts of vitamin C from orange juice and other sources can aid in iron absorption. Also, adequate fruit and vegetable intake allows for meeting vitamin A needs. <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_s01_s03_t01">Table 13.3 "Micronutrient Levels during Older Adolescence"</a> shows the micronutrient recommendations for older adolescents, which differ slightly for males and females, unlike the recommendations for puberty.</p>

These disorders are characterized by overeating or undereating, and include anorexia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and bulimia nervosa.</span></span>, which can have a detrimental effect on diet and health. A study published by North Dakota State University estimates that these conditions impact twenty-four million people in the United States and seventy million worldwide.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_027">North Dakota State University. “Eating Disorder Statistics.” Accessed March 5, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/counseling/Eating_Disorder_Statistics.pdf">http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/counseling/Eating_Disorder_Statistics.pdf</a>.</span> These disorders are more prevalent among adolescent girls, but have been increasing among adolescent boys in recent years. Because eating disorders oftenlead to malnourishment, adolescents with an eating disorder are deprived of the crucial nutrients their still-growing bodies need.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_s02_p02">Eating disorders involve extreme behavior related to food and exercise. Sometimes referred to as “starving or stuffing,” they encompass a group of conditions marked by undereating or overeating. Some of these conditions include:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Anorexia Nervosa. </strong>Anorexia nervosa is a potentially fatal condition characterized by undereating and excessive weight loss. People with this disorder are preoccupied with dieting, calories, and food intake to an unhealthy degree. Anorexics have a poor body image, which leads to anxiety, avoidance of food, a rigid exercise regimen, fasting, and a denial of hunger. The condition predominantly affects females. Between 0.5 and 1 percent of American women and girls suffer from this eating disorder.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Binge-Eating Disorder.</strong> People who suffer from binge-eating disorder experience regular episodes of eating an extremely large amount of food in a short period of time. Binge eating is a compulsive behavior, and people who suffer from it typically feel it is beyond their control. This behavior often causes feelings of shame and embarrassment, and leads to obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, Type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. Both males and females suffer from binge-eating disorder. It affects 1 to 5 percent of the population.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Bulimia Nervosa. </strong>Bulimia nervosa is characterized by alternating cycles of overeating and undereating. People who suffer from it partake in binge eating, followed by compensatory behavior, such as self-induced vomiting, laxative use, and compulsive exercise. As with anorexia, most people with this condition are female. Approximately 1 to 2 percent of American women and girls have this eating disorder.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_028">National Eating Disorders Association. “Learn Basic Terms and Information on a Variety of Eating Disorder Topics.” Accessed March 5, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/information-resources/general-information.php">http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/information-resources/general -information.php</a>.</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s04_s02_p03">Eating disorders stem from stress, low self-esteem, and other psychological and emotional issues. It is important for parents to watch for signs and symptoms of these disorders, including sudden weight loss, lethargy, vomiting after meals, and the use of appetite suppressants. Eating disorders can lead to serious complications or even be fatal if left untreated. Treatment includes cognitive, behavioral, and nutritional therapy.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05_p01">With the onset of adulthood, good nutrition can help young adults enjoy an active lifestyle. For most people, this is the time when their bodies are in the best condition. The body of an adult does not need to devote its energy and resources to support the rapid growth and development that characterizes youth. However, the choices made during those formative years can have a lasting impact. Eating habits and preferences developed during childhood and adolescence influence health and fitness into adulthood. Some adults have gotten a healthy start and have established a sound diet and regular activity program, which helps them remain in good condition from young adulthood into the later years. Others carry childhood obesity into adulthood, which adversely affects their health. However, it is not too late to change course and develop healthier habits and lifestyle choices. Therefore, adults must monitor their dietary decisions and make sure their caloric intake provides the energy that they require, without going into excess.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05_s01_p01">At this time, growth is completed and people reach their physical peak. Major organs and body systems have fully matured by this stage of the life cycle. For example, the human body reaches maximum cardiac output between ages twenty and thirty. Also, bone and muscle mass are at optimal levels, and physical activity helps to improve muscle strength, endurance, and tone.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_029">Elaine U.

Healthy eating habits promote metabolic functioning, assist repair and regeneration, and prevent the development of chronic conditions. In addition, the goals of a young adult, such as beginning a career or seeking out romantic relationships, can be supported with good habits.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05_s01_s01_p01">Young men typically have higher nutrient needs than young women. For ages nineteen to thirty, the energy requirements for women are 1,800 to 2,400 calories, and 2,400 to 3,000 calories for men, depending on activity level. These estimates do not include women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, who require a higher energy intake (see <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch12#zimmerman_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Nutrition through the Life Cycle: From Pregnancy to the Toddler Years"</a>).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05_s01_s02_p01">For carbohydrates, the AMDR is 45 to 65 percent of daily calories. All adults, young and old, should eat fewer energy-dense carbohydrates, especially refined, sugar-dense sources, particularly for those who lead a more sedentary lifestyle. The AMDR for protein is 10 to 35 percent of total daily calories, and should include a variety of lean meat and poultry, eggs, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds. The guidelines also recommend that adults eat two 4-ounce servings (or one 8-ounce serving) of seafood per week.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05_s01_s02_p02">It is also important to replace proteins that are high in trans fats and saturated fat with ones that are lower in solid fats and calories. All adults should limit total fat to 20 to 35 percent of their daily calories and keep saturated fatty acids to less than 10 percent of total calories by replacing them with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Avoid trans fats by limiting foods that contain synthetic sources, such as partially hydrogenated oils. The AMDR for fiber is 22 to 28 grams per day for women and 28 to 34 grams per day for men. Soluble fiber may help improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels, while insoluble fiber can help prevent constipation.</p>

                <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05_s01_s02_p03">A healthy diet of nutrient-rich meals incorporates a variety of whole foods. Whole foods are unprocessed or unrefined, or have been created with as little processing as possible. They do not include a lot of added ingredients, such as sugar, sodium, or fat, and are free of preservatives or other chemicals that are often added to food products. Examples of whole foods with no processing include legumes and fresh fruits and vegetables. Examples of whole foods with minimal processing include whole-grain breads and cereals. Dietitians recommend consuming whole foods for a variety of reasons. Whole foods provide nutrients in their natural state, with all of the vitamins and minerals intact. Food processing can remove some nutrients during manufacturing. Also, diets rich in whole foods contain high concentrations of fiber and antioxidants, and can protect against chronic disease.</p>

The AI for women is 2.7 liters per day, from food and liquids.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_030">Institute of Medicine. “Dietary Reference Intakes: Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate.” Accessed March 5, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Water-Potassium-Sodium-Chloride-and-Sulfate.aspx">http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Water-Potassium-Sodium-Chloride-and-Sulfate.aspx</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05_s02_p01">Good nutrition during the young adult years can help to support gastrointestinal integrity and prevent digestive disorders, such as constipation and diarrhea. Dietary fiber helps bind indigestible food together and normalize bowel movements. It also holds more water in the stool to make it softer for those who suffer from constipation. Excellent sources of fiber include oats, barley, rye, wheat, brown rice, celery, carrots, nuts, seeds, dried beans, oranges, and apples. In addition, healthy intestinal microflora can be supported by prebiotics, which stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria already in the colon and are found in fruits and vegetables, and probiotics, which change or improve the bacterial balance in the gut and are found in yogurt.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_s02_p01">The AMDRs for carbohydrates, protein, fat, fiber, and fluids remain the same from young adulthood into middle age (see <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05#zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05">Section 13.5 "Young Adulthood and Nutrition"</a> of this chapter). It is important to avoid putting on excess pounds and limiting an intake of SoFAAS to help avoid cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic conditions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_s02_p02">There are some differences, however, regarding micronutrients. For men, the recommendation for magnesium increases to 420 milligrams daily, while middle-aged women should increase their intake of magnesium to 320 milligrams per day. Other key vitamins needed during the middle-aged years include folate and vitamins B<sub class="subscript">6</sub> and B<sub class="subscript">12</sub> to prevent elevation of homocysteine, a byproduct of metabolism that can damage arterial walls and lead to atherosclerosis, a cardiovascular condition. Again, it is important to meet nutrient needs with food first, then supplementation, such as a daily multivitamin, if you can’t meet your needs through food.</p>

Preventive nutrition is defined as dietary practices directed toward reducing disease and promoting health and well-being. Healthy eating in general—such as eating unrefined carbohydrates instead of refined carbohydrates and avoiding trans fats and saturated fats—helps to promote wellness. However, there are also some things that people can do to target specific concerns. One example is consuming foods high in antioxidants, such as strawberries, blueberries, and other colorful fruits and vegetables, to reduce the risk of cancer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_s03_p02">Phytochemicals are compounds in fruits and vegetables that act as defense systems for plants. Different phytochemicals are beneficial in different ways. For example, carotenoids, which are found in carrots, cantaloupes, sweet potatoes, and butternut squash, may protect against cardiovascular disease by helping to prevent the oxidation of cholesterol in the arteries, although research is ongoing.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_034">Sari Voutilainen, Tarja Nurmi, Jaakko Mursu, and Tiina H.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Menopause</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s02_p01">In the middle-aged years, women undergo a specific change that has a major effect on their health. They begin the process of menopause, typically in their late forties or early fifties. The ovaries slowly cease to produce estrogen and progesterone, which results in the end of menstruation. Menopausal symptoms can vary, but often include hot flashes, night sweats, and mood changes. The hormonal changes that occur during menopause can lead to a number of physiological changes as well, including alterations in body composition, such as weight gain in the abdominal area. Bone loss is another common condition related to menopause due to the loss of female reproductive hormones. Bone thinning increases the risk of fractures, which can affect mobility and the ability to complete everyday tasks, such as cooking, bathing, and dressing.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_036">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Eating Right During Menopause.” © 1995–2012.

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_p01">Beginning at age fifty-one, requirements change once again and relate to the nutritional issues and health challenges that older people face. After age sixty, blood pressure rises and the immune system may have more difficulty battling invaders and infections. The skin becomes more wrinkled and hair has turned gray or white or fallen out, resulting in hair thinning. Older adults may gradually lose an inch or two in height. Also, short-term memory might not be as keen as it once was.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_037">Beverly McMillan, <em class="emphasis">Illustrated Atlas of the Human Body</em> (Sydney, Australia: Weldon Owen, 2008), 260.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_p02">In addition, many people suffer from serious health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Being either underweight or overweight is also a major concern for the elderly. However, many older adults remain in relatively good health and continue to be active into their golden years. Good nutrition is often the key to maintaining health later in life. In addition, the fitness and nutritional choices made earlier in life set the stage for continued health and happiness.</p>
    <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Older Adulthood (Ages Fifty-One and Older): The Golden Years</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s01_p01">An adult’s body changes during old age in many ways, including a decline in hormone production, muscle mass, and strength. Also in the later years, the heart has to work harder because each pump is not as efficient as it used to be. Kidneys are not as effective in excreting metabolic products such as sodium, acid, and potassium, which can alter water balance and increase the risk for over- or underhydration. In addition, immune function decreases and there is lower efficiency in the absorption of vitamins and minerals.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s01_p02">Older adults should continue to consume nutrient-dense foods and remain physically active. However, deficiencies are more common after age sixty, primarily due to reduced intake or malabsorption. The loss of mobility among frail, homebound elderly adults also impacts their access to healthy, diverse foods.</p>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Energy</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s01_s01_p01">Due to reductions in lean body mass and metabolic rate, older adults require less energy than younger adults. The energy requirements for people ages fifty-one and over are 1,600 to 2,200 calories for women and 2,000 to 2,800 calories for men, depending on activity level. The decrease in physical activity that is typical of older adults also influences nutritional requirements.</p>

        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Macronutrients</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s01_s02_p01">The AMDRs for carbohydrates, protein, and fat remain the same from middle age into old age (see <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05#zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05">Section 13.5 "Young Adulthood and Nutrition"</a> of this chapter for specifics). Older adults should substitute more unrefined carbohydrates for refined ones, such as whole grains and brown rice. Fiber is especially important in preventing constipation and diverticulitis, and may also reduce the risk of colon cancer. Protein should be lean, and healthy fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids, are part of any good diet.</p>

        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Micronutrients</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s01_s03_p01">An increase in certain micronutrients can help maintain health during this life stage. The recommendations for calcium increase to 1,200 milligrams per day for both men and women to slow bone loss. Also to help protect bones, vitamin D recommendations increase to 10–15 micrograms per day for men and women. Vitamin B<sub class="subscript">6</sub> recommendations rise to 1.7 milligrams per day for older men and 1.5 milligrams per day for older women to help lower levels of homocysteine and protect against cardiovascular disease. As adults age, the production of stomach acid can decrease and lead to an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. This can affect the absorption of vitamin B<sub class="subscript">12</sub> and cause a deficiency. As a result, older adults need more B<sub class="subscript">12</sub> than younger adults, and require an intake of 2.4 micrograms per day, which helps promote healthy brain functioning. For elderly women, higher iron levels are no longer needed postmenopause and recommendations decrease to 8 milligrams per day. People over age fifty should eat foods rich with all of these micronutrients.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Nutritional Concerns for Older Adults</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s02_p01">Dietary choices can help improve health during this life stage and address some of the nutritional concerns that many older adults face. In addition, there are specific concerns related to nutrition that affect adults in their later years. They include medical problems, such as disability and disease, which can impact diet and activity level. For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to dehydration.</p>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Sensory Issues</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s02_s01_p01">At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number. As a result, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">taste threshold</a><span class="glossdef">Minimum concentration at which taste sensitivity to a food or substance can be perceived.</span></span> is higher in older adults, meaning that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste. Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty, sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of digestive enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s02_s02_p01">A number of gastrointestinal issues can affect food intake and digestion among the elderly. Saliva production decreases with age, which affects chewing, swallowing, and taste. Digestive secretions decline later in life as well, which can lead to atrophic gastritis (inflammation of the lining of the stomach). This interferes with the absorption of some vitamins and minerals. Reduction of the digestive enzyme lactase results in a decreased tolerance for dairy products. Slower gastrointestinal motility can result in more constipation, gas, and bloating, and can also be tied to low fluid intake, decreased physical activity, and a diet low in fiber, fruits, and vegetables.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Dysphagia</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s02_s03_p01">Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency. For example, solid foods can be pureed, ground, or chopped to allow more successful and safe swallow. This decreases the risk of aspiration, which occurs when food flows into the respiratory tract and can result in pneumonia. Typically, speech therapists, physicians, and dietitians work together to determine the appropriate diet for dysphagia patients.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s02_s04_p01">Similar to other life stages, obesity is a concern for the elderly. Adults over age sixty are more likely to be obese than young or middle-aged adults. As explained throughout this chapter, excess body weight has severe consequences. Being overweight or obese increases the risk for potentially fatal conditions that can afflict the elderly. They include cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States, and Type 2 diabetes, which causes about seventy thousand deaths in the United States annually.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_038">Centers for Disease Control, National Center for Health Statistics. “Deaths and Mortality.” Last updated January 27, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm</a>.</span> Obesity is also a contributing factor for a number of other conditions, including arthritis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s02_s04_p02">For older adults who are overweight or obese, dietary changes to promote weight loss should be combined with an exercise program to protect muscle mass. This is because dieting reduces muscle as well as fat, which can exacerbate the loss of muscle mass due to aging. Although weight loss among the elderly can be beneficial, it is best to be cautious and consult with a health-care professional before beginning a weight-loss program.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s02_s05_p01">In addition to concerns about obesity among senior citizens, being underweight can be a major problem. A condition known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">anorexia of aging</a><span class="glossdef">A condition that affects the elderly and is characterized by poor food intake.</span></span> is characterized by poor food intake, which results in dangerous weight loss. This major health problem among the elderly leads to a higher risk for immune deficiency, frequent falls, muscle loss, and cognitive deficits. Reduced muscle mass and physical activity mean that older adults need fewer calories per day to maintain a normal weight. It is important for health care providers to examine the causes for anorexia of aging among their patients, which can vary from one individual to another. Understanding why some elderly people eat less as they age can help health-care professionals assess the risk factors associated with this condition. Decreased intake may be due to disability or the lack of a motivation to eat. Also, many older adults skip at least one meal each day. As a result, some elderly people are unable to meet even reduced energy needs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s02_s05_p02">Nutritional interventions should focus primarily on a healthy diet. Remedies can include increasing the frequency of meals and adding healthy, high-calorie foods (such as nuts, potatoes, whole-grain pasta, and avocados) to the diet.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s07_s03_p01">The foods you consume in your younger years influence your health as you age. Good nutrition and regular physical activity can help you live longer and healthier. Conversely, poor nutrition and a lack of exercise can shorten your life and lead to medical problems. The right foods provide numerous benefits at every stage of life. They help an infant grow, an adolescent develop mentally and physically, a young adult achieve his or her physical peak, and an older adult cope with aging. Nutritious foods form the foundation of a healthy life at every age.</p>
