        <h2 class="title editable block">Chronic Diseases</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p01">Chronic diseases are ongoing, life-threatening, and life-altering health challenges. They are the leading cause of death worldwide. Chronic conditions are increasing in frequency. They cause significant physical and emotional suffering and are an impediment to economic growth and vitality. It is important, now more than ever, to understand the different risk factors for chronic disease and to learn how to prevent their development.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Risk Factors of Chronic Disease</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01_p01">A <strong class="emphasis bold">risk factor</strong> is a signal that your chances for acquiring a chronic disease may be increased. You might liken a risk factor to the flags that lifeguards sometimes set up at beaches. When you see these flags, you know immediately that swimming within the marked areas could be hazardous, and that if you choose to swim within these parameters anyway, you are doing so at your own risk. But, if you heed the warnings, you are taking the necessary step to protect your safety and health. Similarly, risk factors are warning signs that coincide with the development and progression of disease. However, risk factors are not a 100-percent guarantee that a person will develop a chronic disease, only that the conditions are right. For example, if a person gets sick with the flu, we can say with certainty that the illness was caused by a virus. However, we cannot say that a sedentary lifestyle caused the onset of cardiovascular disease in a patient, because a risk factor indicates a correlation, not a causation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01_p02">Chronic disease usually develops alongside a combination of the following risk factors: genetics, a prior disease such as obesity or hypertension, dietary and lifestyle choices, and environmental problems. Risk factors such as genetics and age cannot be changed. However, some risk factors can be altered to promote health and wellness (such as diet). For example, a person who continuously eats a diet high in sugars, saturated fats, and red meat is at risk for becoming obese and developing Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or several other conditions. Making more healthy dietary choices can greatly reduce that risk. Being a woman over age sixty-five is a risk factor for developing osteoporosis, but that cannot be changed. Also, people without a genetic predisposition for a particular chronic illness can still develop it. Not having a genetic predipostion for a chronic disease is not a guarantee of immunity.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Identifying Your Risk Factors</h3>
                <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01_p03">To estimate your own risk factors for developing certain chronic diseases, search through your family’s medical history. What diseases do you note showing up among close blood relatives? This may be of concern to you. At your next physical, pay attention to your blood tests and ask the doctor if any results are out of normal range. It is also helpful to note your vital signs, particularly your blood pressure and resting heart rate. In addition, you may wish to keep a food diary to make a note of the dietary choices that you make on a regular basis and be aware of foods that are high in saturated fat, among other unhealthy options. As a general rule, it is important to look for risk factors that you can modify.to promote your health. For example, if you discover that your grandmother, aunt, and uncle all suffered from high blood pressure, then you may decide to avoid a high sodium diet. Identifying your risk factors can arm you with the information you need to help ward off disease.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Cardiovascular Disease</h2>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p01">Throughout the remainder of this section, we will examine some of the more prevalent chronic diseases, their risk factors, and the choices that can help to discourage their development or progression. Let’s begin with cardiovascular disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_025">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Leading Causes of Death.” Last updated September 6, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod..htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm</a>.</span> The disease generally starts with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">atherosclerosis</a><span class="glossdef">Disease that is characterized by the deposition of plaques and fatty material in the walls of the body’s artery, vein and blood vessel network.</span></span>, or a hardening of the arteries, a chronic condition so common that most people show signs of it by the time they turn thirty. Arteries start to narrow and harden when fats accumulate along their inner walls and form plaques. A plaque is made of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in blood.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p02">Plaque formation causes arteries to narrow and harden, which elevates blood pressure because the vessels can’t expand effectively to accommodate blood pulses. Higher blood pressure strains the heart and causes more damage. Arterial walls can become so weakened due to high blood pressure that they balloon and form what is known as an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aneurysm</a><span class="glossdef">Swelling or enlargement of the artery due to a weakening in the artery wall.</span></span>. If the aneurysm bursts, it becomes a life-threatening event. The plaques themselves can also rupture due to a spike in blood pressure or a tremor along an arterial wall, and the body responds to this perceived injury by forming blood clots. These clots are serious health threats, whether they are stationary (a thrombus) or moving (an embolus). A stable clot can slowly kill off surrounding tissue, or grow so big that it blocks blood circulation and causes <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thrombosis</a><span class="glossdef">Development of a blood clot inside of a blood vessel.</span></span>. When a moving clot becomes stuck in an artery too small for its passage, it cuts off blood flow and causes cell death. This is referred to as an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">embolism</a><span class="glossdef">Blood vessel obstruction caused by a mass, such as a detached blood clot or other foreign body, that circulates in the bloodstream.</span></span>. Blood clots in heart and brain arteries can cause heart attacks or strokes.</p>

It is helpful to lower sodium intake, increase consumption of dietary fiber, and limit consumption of saturated fat, which promotes plaque formation. In addition, it is important to replace refined starches and added sugar, which can boost triglycerides, with whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, especially fish, using alcohol in moderation, and opting for low or no-fat dairy products can all help reduce your cardiovascular disease risk. Emphasizing vegetable-based sources of protein, such as beans and legumes, can be beneficial, as well as consuming more soy products. It is also important to maintain a healthy weight, manage cholesterol levels, and avoid smoking or chewing tobacco.</p>

Cancer is triggered by mutations in a cell’s genetic material. The cause of these changes may be inherited, or it may result from exposure to carcinogens, which are agents that can cause cancer. Carcinogens include chemicals, viruses, certain medical treatments such as radiation, pollution, or other substances and exposures that are known or suspected to cause cancer.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_027">American Cancer Society. “Known and Probable Human Carcinogens.” Last medical review June 29, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/GeneralInformationaboutCarcinogens/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens">http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/GeneralInformationaboutCarcinogens/known-and-probable -human-carcinogens</a>.</span> The National Institutes of Health has classified fifty-four different compounds as known cancer-causing agents in humans.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_028">Brett Israel, “How Many Cancers Are Caused by the Environment?” <em class="emphasis">Scientific American</em>, 21 May 2010. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-many-cancers-are-caused-by-the-environment">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-many -cancers-are-caused-by-the-environment</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s04_p02">Under normal conditions, a healthy cell will either repair any damage that has been done or self destruct so that no future cells will be affected. Cells become cancerous when their DNA is damaged, but they do not self-destruct or stop reproducing as normal cells would. As these abnormal cells continue their rapid growth, in most cancers they coalesce in a mass called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tumor</a><span class="glossdef">Abnormal mass of body tissue that results from uncontrolled and progressive cell growth.</span></span>. Cancer cells can overwhelm healthy cells and interfere with the healthy functioning of the body.

Scientists and the medical community are giving considerable attention to the early stages of cancer, from the moment a healthy cell is exposed to a carcinogen to the point where cells with damaged DNA are replicating out of control. Intervention at any of these early stages could prove to be quite beneficial, because it is thought that most cancers are the result of lifestyle choices and environmental exposure.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s04_s01_p02">The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) has published guidelines for preventing cancer and staying healthy. They include several dietary and lifestyle choices, such as participating in physical activity for thirty minutes per day or more, and maintaining a healthy weight. In addition, AICR recommends consuming a plant-based diet.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_030">American Institute for Cancer Research. “Guidelines for Cancer Prevention.” No. E93-GL. © November 2007. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://preventcancer.aicr.org/site/DocServer/Guidelines_Brochure.pdf?docID=3561">http://preventcancer.aicr.org/site/DocServer/Guidelines_Brochure.pdf?docID=3561</a>.</span> Several epidemiological studies have found a link between eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and a low incidence of certain cancers. Fruits and vegetables containing a wide variety of nutrients and phytochemicals may either prevent or reduce the oxidative damage to cell structures. Cruciferous vegetables, such as cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts, may also reduce the risk of certain cancers, such as endometrial, esophageal, and others. Also, studies have shown that the more fiber you have in your diet, the lower your risk of colon cancer.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s04_s01_p03">Supplementation may also be helpful to a limited degree. Vitamin D and antioxidants have been linked to lowering the risk of some cancers (however taking an iron supplement may promote others). But, obtaining vital nutrients from food first is the best way to help prevent or manage cancer. In addition, regular and vigorous exercise can lower the risk of breast and colon cancers, among others. Also, wear sunblock, stay in the shade, and avoid the midday sun to protect yourself from skin cancer, which is one of the most common kinds of cancer.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn15_031">Mayo Clinic. “Cancer Prevention: 7 Steps to Reduce Your Risk.” September 21, 2010.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s05_s01_p01">Unfortunately, Type 1 diabetes is almost impossible to prevent, although some clinical research suggests that breastfeeding an infant for at least three months may decrease the child’s risk of developing this condition. However, people who are at risk for Type 2 or gestational diabetes can take steps to avoid the disease. For example, it is crucial to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight through regular physical activity. If you are at risk, strive for at least thirty minutes of moderate to intense exercise at least three times per week. Proper nutrition is also vital, and it is important to restrict sugary snacks, beverages, and desserts, and to limit the intake of trans fats and saturated fats. In addition, those who are at risk should consume whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, along with two servings of nonfried fish per week.</p>

A diet that supplies your body with the needed energy and nutrients daily will result in efficient body functioning and in protection from disease. Making sound nutritional choices can also provide support for individuals undergoing treatment for short-term or chronic conditions.
