    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_p01">Puberty is the beginning of adolescence. The onset of puberty brings a number of changes, including the development of primary and secondary sex characteristics, growth spurts, an increase in body fat, and an increase in bone and muscle development. All of these changes must be supported with adequate intake and healthy food choices.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Onset of Puberty (Ages Nine to Thirteen)</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p01">This period of physical development is divided into two phases. The first phase involves height increases from 20 to 25 percent. Puberty is second to the prenatal period in terms of rapid growth as the long bones stretch to their final, adult size. Girls grow 2–8 inches (5–20 centimeters) taller, while boys grow 4–12 inches (10–30 centimeters) taller. The second phase involves weight gain related to the development of bone, muscle, and fat tissue. Also in the midst of puberty, the sex hormones trigger the development of reproductive organs and secondary sexual characteristics, such as pubic hair. Girls also develop “curves,” while boys become broader and more muscular.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_020">Beverly McMillan, <em class="emphasis">Illustrated Atlas of the Human Body</em> (Sydney, Australia: Weldon Owen, 2008), 258.</span></p>

For ages nine to thirteen, girls should consume about 1,400 to 2,200 calories per day and boys should consume 1,600 to 2,600 calories per day. Physically active preteens who regularly participate in sports or exercise need to eat a greater number of calories to account for increased energy expenditures.</p>

Carbohydrates that are high in fiber should make up the bulk of intake. The AMDR for protein is 10 to 30 percent of daily calories (35–105 grams for 1,400 daily calories for girls and 40–120 grams for 1,600 daily calories for boys). The AMDR for fat is 25 to 35 percent of daily calories (39–54 grams for 1,400 daily calories for girls and 44–62 grams for 1,600 daily calories for boys), depending on caloric intake and activity level.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p01">Children need adequate caloric intake for growth, and it is important not to impose very restrictive diets. However, exceeding caloric requirements on a regular basis can lead to childhood obesity, which has become a major problem in North America. Nearly one of three US children and adolescents are overweight or obese.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_021">Let’s Move. “Learn the Facts.” Accessed March 5, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.letsmove.gov/learn-facts/epidemic-childhood-obesity">http://www.letsmove.gov/learn-facts/epidemic-childhood-obesity</a>.</span> In Canada, approximately 26 percent of children and adolescents are overweight or obese.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_022">Childhood Obesity Foundation. “Statistics.” Accessed March 5, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/statistics">http://www.childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/statistics</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p02">There are a number of reasons behind this problem, including:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>larger portion sizes</li>
            <li>limited access to nutrient-rich foods</li>
            <li>increased access to fast foods and vending machines</li>
            <li>lack of breastfeeding support</li>
            <li>declining physical education programs in schools</li>
            <li>insufficient physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle</li>
            <li>media messages encouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p03">Children who suffer from obesity are more likely to become overweight or obese adults. Obesity has a profound effect on self-esteem, energy, and activity level. Even more importantly, it is a major risk factor for a number of diseases later in life, including cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and certain cancers.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_023">World Health Organization. “Obesity and Overweight Fact Sheet.” Last revised March 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p04">A percentile for body mass index (BMI) specific to age and sex is used to determine if a child is overweight or obese. This is more appropriate than the BMI categories used for adults because the body composition of children varies as they develop, and differs between boys and girls. If a child gains weight inappropriate to growth, parents and caregivers should limit energy-dense, nutrient-poor snack foods. Also, children ages three and older can follow the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines of no more than 35 percent of calories from fat (10 percent or less from saturated fat), and no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day. In addition, it is extremely beneficial to increase a child’s physical activity and limit sedentary activities, such as watching television, playing video games, or surfing the Internet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_p05">Programs to address childhood obesity can include behavior modification, exercise counseling, psychological support or therapy, family counseling, and family meal-planning advice. For most, the goal is not weight loss, but rather allowing height to catch up with weight as the child continues to grow. Rapid weight loss is not recommended for preteens or younger children due to the risk of deficiencies and stunted growth.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_s01_p01">One major contributing factor to childhood obesity is the consumption of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">added sugars</a><span class="glossdef">Sugars and other sweeteners (such as high-fructose corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, and molasses), that are added to food at the table, and are also ingredients in food products.</span></span>. Added sugars include not only sugar added to food at the table, but also are ingredients in items such as bread, cookies, cakes, pies, jams, and soft drinks. The added sugar in store-bought items may be listed as white sugar, brown sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, malt syrup, maple syrup, molasses, anhydrous dextrose, crystal dextrose, and concentrated fruit juice. (Not included are sugars that occur naturally in foods, such as the lactose in milk or the fructose in fruits.) In addition, sugars are often “hidden” in items added to foods after they’re prepared, such as ketchup, salad dressing, and other condiments. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, young children and adolescents consume an average of 322 calories per day from added sugars, or about 16 percent of daily calories.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_024">National Center for Health Statistics. “Consumption of Added Sugar among US Children and Adolescents, 2005–2008.” <em class="emphasis">NCHS Data Brief</em>, no. 87, (March 2012). <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db87.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db87.pdf</a>.</span> The primary offenders are processed and packaged foods, along with soda and other beverages. These foods are not only high in sugar, they are also light in terms of nutrients and often take the place of healthier options. Intake of added sugar should be limited to 100–150 calories per day to discourage poor eating habits.</p>

Preteens must be encouraged to lead more active lifestyles to prevent or treat childhood obesity. In the United States, the Let’s Move! campaign inspires kids to start exercising. This program, launched in 2010 by First Lady Michelle Obama, works to solve the problem of rising obesity rates among children, preteens, and teens. It offers information to parents and educators, works to provide healthier food choices in schools and afterschool programs, and helps children become more active. One way the program promotes physical activity is by encouraging preteens and teens to find something they love to do. When kids find an activity they enjoy, whether riding a bike, playing football, joining a soccer team, or participating in a dance crew, they are more likely to get moving and stay healthy.
