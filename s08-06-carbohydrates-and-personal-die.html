    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s06_p01">In this chapter, you learned what carbohydrates are, the different types of carbohydrates in your diet, and that excess consumption of some types of carbohydrates cause disease while others decrease disease risk. Now that we know the benefits of eating the right carbohydrate, we will examine exactly how much should be eaten to promote health and prevent disease.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s06_s01_p01">The Food and Nutrition Board of IOM has set the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of carbohydrates for children and adults at 130 grams per day. This is the average minimum amount the brain requires to function properly. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is between 45 and 65 percent. This means that on a 2,000 kilocalorie diet, a person should consume between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrate each day. According to the IOM not more than 25 percent of total calories consumed should come from added sugars. The World Health Organization and the AHA recommend much lower intakes of added sugars—10 percent or less of total calories consumed. The IOM has also set Adequate Intakes for dietary fiber, which are 38 and 25 grams for men and women, respectively. The recommendations for dietary fiber are based upon the intake levels known to prevent against heart disease.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s06_s02_p01">Carbohydrates are contained in all five food groups: grains, fruits, vegetables, meats, and beans (only in some processed meats and beans), and dairy products. Fast-releasing carbohydrates are more prevalent in fruits, fruit juices, and dairy products, while slow-releasing carbohydrates are more plentiful in starchy vegetables, beans, and whole grains. Fast-releasing carbohydrates are also found in large amounts in processed foods, soft drinks, and sweets. On average, a serving of fruits, whole grains, or starches contains 15 grams of carbohydrates. A serving of dairy contains about 12 grams of carbohydrates, and a serving of vegetables contains about 5 grams of carbohydrates. <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s06_s02_t01">Table 4.4 "Carbohydrates in Foods (grams/serving)"</a> gives the specific amounts of carbohydrates, fiber, and added sugar of various foods.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s06_s02_s01_p01">In choosing dietary sources of carbohydrates the best ones are those that are nutrient dense, meaning they contain more essential nutrients per calorie of energy. In general, nutrient-dense carbohydrates are minimally processed and include whole-grain breads and cereals, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and beans. In contrast, empty-calorie carbohydrate foods are highly processed and often contain added sugars and fats. Soft drinks, cakes, cookies, and candy are examples of empty-calorie carbohydrates. They are sometimes referred to as ‘bad carbohydrates,’ as they are known to cause health problems when consumed in excess.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s06_s02_s02_p01">While nutrition facts labels aid in determining the amount of carbohydrates you eat, they do not help in determining whether a food is refined or not. The ingredients list provides some help in this regard. It identifies all of the food’s ingredients in order of concentration, with the most concentrated ingredient first. When choosing between two breads, pick the one that lists whole wheat (not wheat flour) as the first ingredient, and avoid those with other flour ingredients, such as white flour or corn flour. (Enriched wheat flour refers to white flour with added vitamins.) Eat less of products that list HFCS and other sugars such as sucrose, honey, dextrose, and cane sugar in the first five ingredients. If you want to eat less processed foods then, in general, stay away from products with long ingredient lists. On the front of food and beverages the manufacturers may include claims such as “sugar-free,” “reduced sugar,” “high fiber,” etc.. The Nutrition and Labeling Act of 1990 has defined for the food industry and consumers what these labels mean (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s06_s02_s02_t01">Table 4.5 "Food Labels Pertaining to Carbohydrates"</a>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s06_s03_p01">Carbohydrates are in most foods so you have a great variety of choices with which to meet the carbohydrates recommendations for a healthy diet. The <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines</em> recommends eating more unrefined carbohydrates and more fiber, and reducing consumption of foods that are high in added sugars. To accomplish these recommendations use some or all of the following suggestions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s06_s03_l01">
            <li>Get more daily carbohydrate servings from whole grains by eating a whole-grain cereal for breakfast, using whole-grain bread to make a sandwich for lunch, and eating a serving of beans and/or nuts with dinner.</li>
            <li>Make sure to get at least three servings (or more) of all the grains you eat as whole grains every day. A serving of whole grains is equal to one slice of whole-wheat bread, one ounce of whole-grain cereal, and one-half cup of cooked cereal, brown rice, or whole-wheat pasta.</li>
            <li>Food products made with cornmeal use the whole grain so choose tortillas, corn cereals, and corn breads with cornmeal listed as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>When baking, substitute whole-wheat flour or other whole-grain flour for some of the refined white flour.</li>
            <li>If you like bread at dinner, choose a whole-grain muffin over a Kaiser roll or baguette.</li>
            <li>Add beans, nuts, or seeds to salad—they add texture and taste.</li>
            <li>Choose whole-grain pastas and brown rice, cook al dente, and add some beans and vegetables in equal portions.</li>
            <li>Change it up a bit and experience the taste and satisfaction of other whole grains such as barley, quinoa, and bulgur.</li>
            <li>Eat snacks high in fiber, such as almonds, pistachios, raisins, and air-popped popcorn.</li>
            <li>Add an artichoke and green peas to your dinner plate more often.</li>
            <li>Calm your “sweet tooth” by eating fruits, such as berries or an apple.</li>
            <li>Replace sugary soft drinks with seltzer water, tea, or a small amount of 100 percent fruit juice added to water or soda water.</li>
        </ul>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch04_s06_s03_l02">
                <li>The IOM has set the Recommended Dietary Allowance of carbohydrates for children and adults at 130 grams per day. This is the average minimum amount the brain requires to function properly. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range for total carbohydrates is 45 to 65 percent.</li>
                <li>Carbohydrates are contained in all five food groups: grains, fruits, vegetables, meats and beans (only in some processed meats and beans), and dairy products.</li>
                <li>The <em class="emphasis">2010 Dietary Guidelines</em> recommends eating more slow-releasing carbohydrates and more fiber, and reducing consumption of foods that are high in added sugars. This involves choosing carbohydrate sources that are nutrient-dense, with more essential nutrients per calorie of energy.</li>
