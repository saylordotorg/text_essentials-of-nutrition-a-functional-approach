        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s01_p01">Most beverages marketed in the United States have a Nutrition Facts panel and ingredients list, but some, such as coffee (for home consumption), beer, and wine, do not. As with foods, beverages that are nutrient-dense are the better choices, with the exception of plain water, which contains few to no other nutrients. Beverages do not make you full; they satiate your thirst. Therefore, the fewer calories in a beverage the better it is for avoiding weight gain.

In all age groups the consumption of total beverages provides, on average, 21 percent of daily caloric intake. This is 7 percent higher than the IOM acceptable caloric intake from beverages. Moreover, the high intakes of soft drinks and sugary beverages displace the intake of more nutrient-dense beverages, such as low-fat milk.</p>

This means that drinking a calorie-containing beverage with a meal only provides more calories, as it won’t be offset by eating less food. The Beverage Panel of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill has taken on the challenge of scientifically evaluating the health benefits and risks of beverage groups and providing recommendations for beverage groups (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s02_t01">Table 7.10 "Recommendations of the Beverage Panel"</a>).

In 1974, the US federal government enacted The Safe Drinking Water Act with the intention of providing the American public with safe drinking water. This act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set water-quality standards and assure that the 150,000-plus public water systems in the country adhere to the standards. About 15 percent of Americans obtain drinking water from private wells, which are not subject to EPA standards.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_p05">Most drinking water is disinfected by the process of chlorination, which involves adding chlorine compounds to the water. Chlorination is cheap and effective at killing bacteria. However, it is less effective at removing protozoa, such as <em class="emphasis">Giardia lamblia</em>. Chlorine-resistant protozoa and viruses are instead removed by extensive filtration methods. In the decades immediately following the implementation of water chlorination and disinfection methods in this country, water-borne illnesses, such as cholera and typhoid fever, essentially disappeared in the United States (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_f01">Figure 7.9</a>). In fact, the treatment of drinking water is touted as one of the top public-health achievements of the last century.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_p06">Chlorine reaction with inadequately filtered water can result in the formation of potentially harmful substances. Some of these chlorinated compounds, when present at extremely high levels, have been shown to cause cancer in studies conducted in rodents. In addition to many other contaminants, the EPA has set maximum contaminant levels (legal threshold limits) for these chlorinated compounds in water, in order to guard against disease risk. The oversight of public water systems in this country is not perfect and water-borne illnesses are significantly underreported; however, there are far fewer cases of water-borne illnesses than those attributed to food-borne illnesses that have occurred in the recent past.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Hard versus Soft Water</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_s01_p01">The characteristics of hard water are attributed to higher concentration of calcium and magnesium salts. Hard water is prevalent in the mountain and central time zones and in the Midwestern United States. Hard water is characterized by a calcium carbonate concentration of at least 60 milligrams per liter. Higher concentrations of cations in hard water make it difficult to get soap to lather and clean effectively. Also, the cations precipitate as salts in pipes, dishes, and industrial equipment and can reduce the palatability of drinking water. The average dietary contribution of calcium and magnesium from water ranges between 5 and 20 percent.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_015">World Health Organization. “Hardness in Drinking Water.” © 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf">http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf</a></span> The World Health Organization states that there is no convincing evidence that consumption of hard water adversely affects human health.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_016">World Health Organization. “Hardness in Drinking Water.” © 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf">http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf</a></span> On the contrary, there is some evidence from observational studies that consuming hard water is inversely associated with the incidence of some chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and some cancers, although the studies have not been consistent and often have multiple confounding variables.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_s01_p02">Soft water is produced primarily by running water through a resin system which exchanges sodium cations for calcium and magnesium ions. Treating exceptionally hard waters can significantly increase the sodium concentration in drinking water. The practical benefits of soft water are that soap scum no longer makes dishes and bathrooms dingy, clothes are softer, and there is less of a toll on household and industrial equipment. On the other hand, the increased sodium in soft water can make it taste worse and potentially exacerbate health problems such as hypertension, especially in salt-sensitive populations. Soft water can be treated by a process called “reverse osmosis,” which removes the sodium ions. These filtration systems can be purchased for home use, although their cost is a bit high.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Is Bottled Water a Better Beverage Choice than Tap Water?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_s02_p01">Bottled water is not regulated by the EPA but by FDA. For bottled water, the FDA adheres to the same quality standards as those set by the EPA for tap water. Therefore, the contaminant levels set by the EPA for tap water are not different for bottled water; although there is much less testing, monitoring, and oversight of bottled water in comparison to tap water. Similar to tap water the source and treatment of bottled water determines its taste and quality. Depending on where you live, tap water can be a dietary source of minerals (such as calcium and magnesium), but remember that food rather than water serves as a more prominent dietary source of these minerals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_s02_p02">Distilled and purified bottled waters have had all minerals removed during processing, but not all bottled waters have had minerals removed. Mineral waters, sparkling waters, and Artesian waters are examples of bottled waters that contain some minerals, but they are more expensive. Tap water in the United States costs, on average, much less than one cent per gallon, while bottled water is upwards of three dollars per gallon. Moreover, bottled water uses more resources and produces more waste in comparison to tap water. Iowa State University reports that in the United States alone, the making of plastic bottles for bottled water consumption uses more than 1.5 million barrels of oil every year, which is more than the fuel required for one hundred thousand cars.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_017">Iowa State University. “Bottled Water, Know the Facts.” Accessed October 2, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.extension.iastate.edu/publications/pm1813.pdf">http://www.extension.iastate.edu/publications/pm1813.pdf</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_s02_s01_p01">Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical added to plastics, mostly polycarbonate (which is used to make bottled water containers), and to epoxy resins (which are used to line metal-based containers, such as those used for packaging infant formulas). It has been utilized for these purposes and many others since the 1940s. Most studies evaluating toxicity of BPA demonstrate it does not cause adverse health effects to humans at the levels it exists in for beverage and food containers. However, in January of 2010 the FDA issued an update on BPA uses in the food industry.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_018">US Food and Drug Administration. “Update on Bisphenol A (BPA) for Use in Food Contact Applications.” Last updated March 30, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm197739.htm">http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm197739.htm</a>.</span> This update reports that the FDA, along with the IOM and the National Toxicology Program, “have some concern about the potential effects of BPA on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and young children.”<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_019">US Food and Drug Administration. “Update on Bisphenol A (BPA) for Use in Food Contact Applications.” Last updated March 30, 2012.</span> To address these potential health concerns studies are currently being conducted to further evaluate the risk of adverse health effects associated with exposure to low levels of BPA. In the interim the FDA is taking steps to reduce human exposure to BPA. Many bottled water companies have switched to “BPA-free” plastic containers.</p>
