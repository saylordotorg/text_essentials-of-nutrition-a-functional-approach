    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s00_p02">As discussed in previous chapters, sustainability is a word that’s often talked about in the realm of food and nutrition. The term relates to the goal of achieving a world that meets the needs of its present inhabitants while preserving resources for future generations. As awareness about sustainability has increased among the media and the public, both agricultural producers and consumers have made more of an effort to consider how the choices they make today will impact the planet tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s00_p03">However, defining sustainability can be difficult because the term means different things to different groups. For most, sustainable agriculture can best be described as an umbrella term that encompasses food production and consumption practices that do not harm the environment, that do support agricultural communities, and that are healthy for the consumer.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_001">Sustainable Table. “Introduction to Sustainability.” Accessed October 10, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sustainabletable.org/intro/">http://www.sustainabletable.org/intro/</a>.</span> From factory farms to smaller-scale ranches and granges, sustainable farming practices are being implemented more and more as the long-term viability of the current production system has been called into question.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s00_p04">Yet, the concept of sustainability is not new to agricultural science, practice, or even policy. It has evolved throughout modern history as a way to achieve self-reliance. It is also a vehicle for maintaining rural communities and supporting the concept of conservation and protection of the land.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_002">Ecological Agriculture Projects. “A History of Sustainable Agriculture.” © 1990 Rod MacRae. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://eap.mcgill.ca/AASA_1.htm">http://eap.mcgill.ca/AASA_1.htm</a>.</span> In 1990, the US federal government defined sustainable agriculture in a piece of legislation known as the Farm Bill. The practice was described as an integrated system of plant and animal production that satisfies human needs for food, along with fiber for fabric and other uses. The Farm Bill further defines sustainable agriculture as a practice that enhances environmental quality and also the natural resource base upon which the agricultural economy depends. Sustainable agriculture also makes the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources, sustains the economic viability of farm operations, and supports the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_003">Gold, M.V. “Sustainable Agriculture: Definitions and Terms.” US Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Library. <em class="emphasis">Special Reference Briefs Series</em> no.

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s00_p05">In other words, the practice of sustainable agriculture strives to eschew conventional farming methods, including the cultivation of single crops and row crops continuously over many seasons, the dependency on agribusiness, and the rearing of livestock in concentrated, confined systems.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_004">Gold, M.V. “Sustainable Agriculture: Definitions and Terms.” US Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Library. <em class="emphasis">Special Reference Briefs Series</em> no.

Although many farmers and food companies work to implement these practices, some use the idea of sustainability to attract consumers without completely committing to the concept. “Greenwashing” is a derisive term (similar to “whitewashing”) for a corporation or industry falsely utilizing a proenvironmental image or message to expand its market base.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s00_p06">Sustainability depends not only on agricultural producers, but also on consumers. The average person can do a number of things to consume a more sustainable diet, from eating less meat to purchasing fruits and vegetables grown on nearby farms. For example, produce sold in the Midwest typically travels an average of more than fifteen hundred miles from farm to supermarket. However, increasing the consumption of more locally-grown produce by 10 percent would save thousands of gallons in fossil fuel each year.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_006">Heller, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p01">Diet and cuisine have undergone enormous changes from ancient times to today. The basic diet of the ancient era consisted of cereals, legumes, oil, and wine. These staples were supplemented by vegetables and meat or fish, along with other items, such as honey and salt. During the Middle Ages, poor people consumed meager diets that consisted of small game supplemented with either barley, oat, or rye, while the wealthy had regular access to meat and fish, along with wheat.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_007">Our Food Recipes. “European Medieval Food.” © 2011–2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.our-food-recipes.com/medieval-food.html">http://www.our-food-recipes.com/medieval-food.html</a>.</span> During the Industrial Revolution, diets became more varied, partly because of the development of refrigeration and other forms of food preservation. In the contemporary era, many people have access to a wide variety of food that is grown locally or shipped from far-off places.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_s02_p01">About ten thousand years ago, people began to cultivate crops and domesticate livestock in Mesopotamia, an area of the world that is known today as the Middle East. Agriculture flourished in this region due to the fertile floodplain between the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, and early crops included wheat, barley, and dates. The development of agriculture not only enriched the diet of these early people, it also led to the birth of civilization as farmers began to settle into sizable, stable communities.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_009">Bioworld. “History of Agriculture.” Accessed October 10, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bioworldusa.com/agriculture/history-agriculture">http://www.bioworldusa.com/agriculture/history-agriculture</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_s02_p02">One of the most fertile regions of the ancient world was located along the Nile River Valley in ancient Egypt. The rich soil yielded several harvests per year. Common crops were barley, wheat, lentils, peas, and cabbage, along with grapes, which were used to make wine. Even poor Egyptians ate a reasonably healthy diet that included fish, vegetables, and fruit. However, meat was primarily a privilege of the rich. Popular seasonings of this era included salt, pepper, cumin, coriander, sesame, fennel, and dill.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_010">Experience Ancient Egypt. “Ancient Egyptian Food: The Pharaonic Diet.” © 2009–2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.experience-ancient-egypt.com/ancient-egyptian-food.html">http://www.experience-ancient-egypt.com/ancient-egyptian-food.html</a>.</span></p>

Known as the “three sisters,” these crops proved to be both complementary and sustainable. Corn provides a pole for bean vines to climb. The roots of bean vines provide nitrogen that helps corn grow. These vines also stabilize corn stalks by making them less vulnerable to the wind. Shallow-rooted squash vines prevent the evaporation of soil moisture, while their spiny plants discourage predators. Both of these attributes aid the cultivation of all three crops.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_012">Renee’s Garden. “Celebrate the Three Sisters,”</span> During the post-Columbian era, Native American groups adopted the practice of interplanting squash, beans, and maize, and now thousands of years later, many small farmers continue to cultivate the “three sisters.”</p>

For people of all socioeconomic classes, breakfast and lunch were typically light meals that were often consumed in taverns and cafes. However, dinners were eaten at home and were taken much more seriously. Wealthy senators and landowners ate meals with multiple courses, including appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Rich Romans also held extravagant dinner parties, where guests dined on exotic foods, such as roasted ostrich or pheasant. In contrast, people of the lower classes ate mostly bread and cereals.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_013">PBS. “Home Life.” <em class="emphasis">The Roman Empire in the First Century</em>. © 2006 Devillier Donegan Enterprises. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/home.html">http://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/home.html</a>.</span> The average person ate out of clay dishes, while wealthy people used bronze, gold, or silver.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_s03_p01">The eating habits of most people during the Medieval Era depended mainly on location and financial status. In the feudal system of Europe, the majority of the population could not afford to flavor their food with extravagant spices or sugar. In addition, transporting food was either outrageously expensive or out of the question due to the inability to preserve food for a long period of time. As a result, the common diet consisted of either wheat, meat, or fish, depending on location. The typical diet of the lower classes was based on cereals and grains, porridge, and gruel. These staples were supplemented with seasonal fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Wine, beer, and cider were also common, and were often safer to drink than the unsanitized, untreated water.</p>

Upon their return, the crusaders brought back new foods and spices, exposing Europeans of the Middle Ages to unusual flavors. Cooking with exotic spices, such as black pepper, saffron, and ginger, became associated with wealth because they were expensive and had to be imported.</p>

This was mostly due to an inability to preserve food for long periods. At that time, food preservation consisted mostly of drying, salting, and smoking. Pickling, which is also known as brining or corning, was another common practice and involved the use of fermentation to preserve food.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_s04_p01">The modern era began in North America and Europe with the dawn of the Industrial Age. Before that period, people predominantly lived in agrarian communities. Farming played an important role in the development of the United States and Canada. Almost all areas of the country had agrarian economies dictated by the harvesting seasons.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_s04_p02">In the 1800s, society began to change as new machines made it easier to cultivate crops, and to package, ship, and store food. The invention of the seed drill, the steel plow, and the reaper helped to speed up planting and harvesting. Also, food could be transported more economically as a result of developments in rail and refrigeration. These and other changes ushered in the modern era and affected the production and consumption of food.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_s04_s01_p01">Technological innovations during the 1800s and 1900s also changed the way we cultivate, prepare, and think about food. The invention and refinement of the refrigerator and freezer made it possible for people to store food for much longer periods. This, in turn, allowed for the transportation of food over greater distances. For example, oranges grown in Florida would still be fresh when they arrived in Seattle.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_s04_s01_p02">Prior to refrigeration, people relied on a number of different methods to store and preserve food, such as pickling. Other preservation techniques included using sugar or honey, canning, and preparing a confit, which is one of the oldest ways to preserve food and involves salting meat and cooking it in its own fat. To store foods for long periods, people used iceboxes or kept vegetables, such as potatoes, onions, and winter squash, in cellars during the winter months.</p>

This was partly because extreme droughts turned parts of the Midwest into a Dust Bowl, where farmers struggled to raise crops. Millions of Americans were unemployed or underemployed and were forced to wait in long breadlines for free food. This was also a period of incredible reforms, as the government worked to provide for and protect the people. Some important changes included <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subsidies</a><span class="glossdef">Federal funding given to an agricultural producer to provide assistance and support.</span></span> and support for suffering farmers.</p>

At that time, people voluntarily made due with less to ensure that soldiers training and fighting overseas had the supplies they needed. To focus on saving at home, government programs included rationing food (particularly meat, butter, and sugar), while the media encouraged families to plant their own fruits and vegetables in “victory” (backyard) gardens.</p>

Large-scale agribusiness is typical for both crop cultivation and livestock rearing, including concentrated animal feeding operations. Conventional farming practices can include abuses to animals and the land. Therefore, more and more consumers have begun to seek out organic and locally grown foods from smaller-scale farms that are less harmful to the environment.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_s04_s04_p02">Other changes also affect food production and consumption in the modern era. The invention of the microwave in the 1950s spurred the growth of frozen foods and TV dinners. Appliances such as blenders and food processors, toasters, coffee and espresso machines, deep fryers, and indoor grills have all contributed to the convenience of food preparation and the kinds of meals that people enjoy cooking and eating.</p>

                    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_s04_s04_s01_p01">Today, consumers can choose from a huge variety of dietary choices that were not available in the past. For example, strawberries can be purchased in New York City in wintertime, because they are quickly and easily transported from places where the crop is in season, such as California, Mexico, or South America. In the western world, especially in North America, food products are also relatively cheap. As a result, there is much less disparity between the diets of the lower and upper classes than in the past. It would not be unusual to find the same kind of meat or poultry served for dinner in a wealthy neighborhood as in a poorer community.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Food System</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_p01">The food system is a network of farmers and related operations, including food processing, wholesale and distribution, retail, industry technology, and marketing. The milk industry, for example, includes everything from the farm that raises livestock, to the milking facility that extracts the product, to the processing company that pasteurizes milk and packages it into cartons, to the shipping company that delivers the product to stores, to the markets and groceries that stock and sell the product, to the advertising agency that touts the product to consumers. All of these components play a part in a very large system.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s01_p01">Two important aspects of a food system are preservation and processing. Each provides for or protects consumers in different ways. Food preservation includes the handling or treating of food to prevent or slow down spoilage. Food processing involves transforming raw ingredients into packaged food, from fresh-baked goods to frozen dinners. Although there are numerous benefits to both, preservation and processing also pose some concerns, in terms of both nutrition and sustainability.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s01_s01_p01">Food preservation protects consumers from harmful or toxic food. There are different ways to preserve food. Some are ancient methods that have been practiced for generations, such as curing, smoking, pickling, salting, fermenting, canning, and preserving fruit in the form of jam. Others include the use of modern techinques and technology, including drying, vacuum packing, pasteurization, and freezing and refrigeration. Preservation guards against food-bourne illnesses, and also protects the flavor, color, moisture content, or nutritive value of food.</p>

                    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s01_s01_s01_p02">Most forms of preservation can affect the quality of food. For example, freezing slightly affects the nutritional content, curing and smoking can introduce carcinogens, and salting greatly increases the sodium. There are also concerns about the effects of using irradiation to preserve food. Studies have shown that this process can change the flavor, texture, color, odor, and nutritional content of food. For example, the yolks of irradiated eggs have less color than nonirradiated eggs.</p>

                    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s01_s02_s01_p01">Food processing has a number of important benefits, such as creating products that have a much longer shelf life than raw foods. Also, food processing protects the health of the consumer and allows for easier shipment and the marketing of foods by corporations. However, there are certain drawbacks. Food processing can reduce the nutritional content of raw ingredients. For example, canning involves the use of heat, which destroys the vitamin C in canned fruit. Also, certain food additives that are included during processing, such as high fructose corn syrup, can affect the health of a consumer. However, the level of added sugar can make a major difference. Small amounts of added sugar and other sweeteners, about 6 to 9 teaspoons a day or less, are not considered harmful.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_019">American Heart Association. “Sugar and Carbohydrates.” Last updated October 12, 2010. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyDietGoals/Sugars-and-Carbohydrates_UCM_303296_Article.jsp#">http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyDietGoals/Sugars-and-Carbohydrates_UCM_303296_Article.jsp#</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s02_p01">Food regulatory agencies work to protect the consumer and ensure the safety of our food. Food and drug regulation in the United States began in the late nineteenth century when state and local governments began to enact regulatory policies. In 1906, Congress passed the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which led to the creation of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Today, a number of agencies are in charge of monitoring how food is produced, processed, and packaged.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_020">EH.Net Encyclopedia. “History of Food and Drug Regulation in the United States.” February 4, 2010. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Law.Food.and.Drug.Regulation">http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Law.Food.and.Drug.Regulation</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s02_s01_p01">Food regulation is divided among different agencies, primarily the FDA and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Regulatory agencies in Canada include the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada. The North American public depends on these and other agencies to ensure that the food they purchase and consume from supermarkets, restaurants, and other sources is safe and healthy to eat. It can be confusing to know which agency monitors and manages which regulatory practice. For example, the FDA oversees the safety of eggs when they’re in the shells, while the USDA is in charge of the eggs once they are out of their shells.</p>

It also monitors supplements, food labels, claims that corporations make about the benefits of products, and pharmaceutical drugs. Sometimes, the FDA must recall contaminated foods and remove them from the market to protect public health. For example, in 2011 contaminated peanut butter led to the recall of thousands of jars of a few popular brands.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_021">US Food and Drug Administration. “FDA 101: Product Recalls—From First Alert to Effectiveness Checks.” Last updated September 9, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm049070.htm">http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm049070.htm</a>.</span> Recalls are almost always voluntary and often are requested by companies after a problem has been discovered. In rare cases, the FDA will request a recall. But no matter what triggers the removal of a product, the FDA’s role is to oversee the strategy and assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the recall.

                    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s03_s01_s01_p01">The FDA works to protect the public from potentially dangerous additives. Passed in 1958, the Food Additives Amendment states that a manufacturer is responsible for demonstrating the safety of an additive before it can be approved. The Delaney Clause that was added to this legislation prohibits the approval of any additive found to cause cancer in animals or humans. However, most additives are considered to be “generally recognized as safe,” a status that is determined by the FDA and referred to as GRAS.</p>
                    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s03_s01_s01_p02">Food additives are typically included in the processing stage to improve the quality and consistency of a product. Many additives also make items more “shelf stable,” meaning they will last a lot longer on store shelves and can generate more profit for store owners. Additives can also help to prevent spoilage that results from changes in temperature, damage during distribution, and other adverse conditions. In addition, food additives can protect consumers from exposure to rancid products and food-bourne illnesses.</p>
                    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s03_s01_s01_p03">Food additives aren’t always beneficial, however. Some substances have been associated with certain diseases if consumed in large amounts. For example, the FDA estimates that sulfites can cause allergic reactions in 1 percent of the general population and in 5 percent of asthmatics. Similarly, the additive monosodium glutamate, which is commonly known as MSG, may cause headaches, nausea, weakness, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, and chest pain in some individuals.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_024">Sustainable Table. “The Issues: Additives.” Accessed October 10, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sustainabletable.org/issues/additives/#fn14">http://www.sustainabletable.org/issues/additives/#fn14</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s04_p01">As mentioned earlier, new technology has had a tremendous effect on the food we eat and the customs and culture related to food consumption. For example, microwaves are used to reduce cooking time or to heat up leftover food. Refrigerators and freezers allow produce to travel great distances and last longer. On the extreme end of making food last longer, there is special food for astronauts that is appropriate for consumption in space. It is safe to store, easy to prepare in the low-gravity environment of a spacecraft, and contains balanced nutrition to promote the health of people working in space. In the military, soldiers consume Meals Ready-to-Eat (MREs), which contain an entire meal in a single pouch.</p>

Although genetic engineering has improved productivity for farmers, it has also stirred up debate about consumer safety and environmental protection. Possible side effects related to the consumption of GM foods include an increase in allergenicity, or tendencies to provoke allergic reactions. There is also some concern related to the possible transfer of the genes used to create genetically engineered foods from plants to people. This could influence human health if antibiotic-resistant genes are transferred to the consumer. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other groups have encouraged the use of genetic engineering without antibiotic-resistance genes. Genetically modified plants may adversely affect the environment as well and could lead to the contamination of nongenetically engineered organisms.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_027">World Health Organization. “Food Safety: 20 Questions on Genetically Modified Foods.” © 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/">http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_s04_s02_p01">Many foods are enriched or fortified to boost their nutritional value. Enrichment involves adding nutrients to restore those that were lost during processing. For example, iron and certain B vitamins are added to white flour to replace the nutrients that are removed in the process of milling wheat. Fortification is slightly different than enrichment and involves adding new nutrients to enhance a food’s nutritive value. For example, folic acid is typically added to cereals and grain products, while calcium is added to some orange juice.</p>

For example, adding iodine to salt has virtually eliminated iodine deficiencies, which protects against thyroid problems. Adding folic acid to wheat helps increase intake for pregnant women, which decreases the risk of neural tube defects in their children. Also, vegans or other people who do not consume many dairy products are able to drink orange juice or soy milk that has been fortified with calcium to meet the daily recommendations. However, there is some concern that foods of little nutritive value will be fortified in an effort to improve their allure, such as soft drinks with added vitamins.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s03_p01">Some people have begun to view their choices regarding diet and nutrition in light of their political views. More and more, consumers weigh their thoughts on the environment and the world, while making decisions about what to purchase in the grocery store. For example, many people choose to eat free-range chickens due to concerns about animal welfare. Others worry about the higher cost of organically produced food or find that those products are not available in their communities. As a result, feelings about food have become a political mine field.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Food Politics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s03_s01_p01">The production and sale of food is an extremely big business and touches people in all industries and walks of life. Food is not only crucial for day-to-day survival, but also strongly affects overall health and well-being, as well as the economy and culture of a region or a country. So, it is no wonder that more and more producers and consumers alike are speaking out about food to ensure that their interests are protected. Food politics can influence many stakeholders and interests, but always involve the production, regulation, inspection, distribution, and/or retail of food.</p>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s03_s01_s01">

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s03_s01_s01_p01">Stakeholders in food politics include large and small farmers, along with large and small food companies. Other important stakeholders include restaurants and other food-service providers, food distributors, grocery stores and other retail outlets, consumers, and trade associations. Antihunger advocates, nutrition advocates, and food-industry lobbyists also have important roles to play. Nongovernmental organizations, such as the American Cancer Society and the WHO, also work to promote good health and nutrition. Each group has its own perspective and its own agenda in disputes related to food.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s03_s01_s02_p01">Food politics can be influenced by ethical, cultural, medical, and environmental disputes over agricultural methods and regulatory policies. They are also greatly influenced by manufacturing processes, marketing practices, and the pursuit of the highest possible profit margin by food manufacturers and distributers. Common disputes and controversies include the genetic modification of plants, the potential dangers of food additives, chemical run-off from large-scale farms, and the reliance on factory-farming practices, such as the use of pesticides in crop cultivation and antibiotics in livestock feed. Additional issues and concerns include the use of sugar, salt, and other potentially unhealthy ingredients, the promotion of fast food and junk food to children, and sanitary standards related to livestock.</p>

                <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s03_s01_s02_p02">One current dispute relates to the use of nitrates in agriculture. At the dawn of the twentieth century, German chemists Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch invented a system that synthesizes ammonia to produce nitrates on an industrial scale. The compound could then be used to make fertilizers, which along with pesticides and herbicides, made large-scale, modern agriculture possible. However, when nitrates are used in excess, they can create runoff that pollutes surface- and groundwater. For example, chemical runoff has had a profound effect on the Aral Sea and the surrounding area in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The Aral Sea, which was once one of the four largest lakes in the world, was crucial to irrigation projects in the former Soviet Union. But when the lake became contaminated by farm runoff, salinity increased and the lake dramatically shrank, crippling the area’s fishing industry. Also, as the lakebed became exposed, dust storms spread contaminated soil, and thousands of people were forced out of the region.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_029">Grant, L. “Nitrates: Dangerous Necessity.” Environmentalism @ Suite 101.com.

As previously discussed, government agencies regulate the proper processing and preparation of foods, as well as overseeing shipping and storage. They pay particular attention to concerns related to public health. As a result, the enforcement of regulations has been strongly influenced by public concern over food-related events, such as outbreaks of food-bourne illnesses.</p>

It addresses policy related to federal food programs and other responsibilities of the USDA. The Farm Bill also covers a wide range of agricultural programs and provisions, including farm subsidies and rural development. And, it influences international trade, commodity prices, environmental preservation, and food safety.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s03_s01_s03_s04_p02">The massive Farm Bill is updated and renewed every five years.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s03_s01_s03_s05_p01">The Farm Bill can directly and indirectly have wide-ranging effects. For example, the bill dictates subsidies and other forms of agricultural funding or support. Farmers rely on this kind of support to offset varying crop yields and unfavorable weather conditions. The agricultural industry also depends on the federal government to provide some form of price control to guard against flooding the market and dragging down prices. As an example, major changes in the policy of agricultural subsidies were implemented in the 1970s to increase farm incomes and produce cheaper food. As a result of these policies and subsidies, much more corn was grown, giving rise to high fructose corn syrup as a primary sweetener in a number of products today, since corn syrup is cheaper to produce. It is also sweeter than cane sugar, which encouraged its widespread use.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s03_s01_s03_s05_p02">Historically, Congress has pursued farm support programs to ensure that the US population has continued access to abundant and affordable food. However, some leaders worry about the effectiveness of government programs as well as the cost to taxpayers and consumers. Others question if continued farm support is even needed and wonder if it remains compatible with current economic objectives, domestic policy, trade policy, and regulatory restrictions.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_033">Johnson, R. and J. Monke, “What Is the ‘Farm Bill’?” Congressional Research Service. <em class="emphasis">CRS Report for Congress</em>, no.

Regarding all of these issues, Congress must heed the demands of its constituents. In the end, it is inevitable that consumers’ growing interest in food issues will affect not only the choices they make in the grocery store, but also the decisions they make in the voting booth.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s04_p03">Rising agricultural commodity prices have led to concerns about food insecurity and hunger. In an agricultural outlook report for 2010–2020, the Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development states, “While higher prices are generally good news for farmers, the effect on the poor in developing countries who spend a high proportion of their income on food can be devastating.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p01">The cost of our food is influenced by the policies and practices of farms, food and beverage companies, food wholesalers, food retailers, and food service companies. These costs include the energy required to produce and distribute food products from farm field to supermarket to table. Rising prices also reflect the marketing and advertising of food. All of these factors affect all participants in a food system, but some participants are more affected than others. A 2011 report by the Economic Research Service of the USDA shows the division of the consumer food dollar among various aspects of the American food system. A far greater amount of the money you spend to buy a product goes toward the marketing components than toward the actual farmer.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_300">US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. “Overview.” Last updated November 19, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-expenditures.aspx">http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-expenditures.aspx</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_p01">Food prices and inflation disproportionately affect people at lower income levels. For the poorest people of the world, increasing prices can raise levels of hunger and starvation. In many developing countries where the cost for staple crops steadily rises, consumers have faced shortages or even the fear of shortages, which can result in hoarding and rioting. This happened in 2007 and 2008 during rice shortages in India and other parts of Asia. Rioters burned hundreds of food ration stores in the Indian region West Bengal. In the West African nation Burkina Faso, food rioters looted stores and burned government buildings as a result of rising prices for food and other necessities.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_037">Vivienne Walt, “The World’s Growing Food-Price Crisis,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em> Magazine, 27 February 2008. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1717572-1,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1717572-1,00.html</a>.</span> In some poor countries, protests also have been fueled by concerns over corruption, because officials earned fortunes from oil and minerals, while locals struggled to put food on their tables. Bringing down prices would quell protests, but could take a decade or more to accomplish.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p01">Concerns about food shortages and rising prices reflect the end of the era of cheap food. Following World War II, grain prices fell steadily around the world for decades. As farms grew in scale, factory-farm practices, such as the use of synthetic and mined fertilizers and pesticides, increased. Agribusinesses also invested in massive planting and harvesting machines. These practices pushed crop yields up and crop prices down. Food became so inexpensive that we entered what came to be called the “era of cheap food.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p02">However, by 2008, economic experts had declared that the era of cheap food was over. The rapid growth in farm output had slowed to the point that it failed to keep pace with population increases and rising affluence in once-developing nations. Consumption of four staples—wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans—outstripped production and resulted in dramatic stockpile decreases. The consequence of this imbalance has been huge spikes felt moderately in the West and to a much greater degree in the developing world. As a result, hunger has worsened for tens of millions of poor people around the world.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_038">Justin Gillis, “A Warming Planet Struggles to Feed Itself,” <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, 4 June 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html?_r=2&amp;hp">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/science/earth/05harvest.html?_r=2&amp;hp</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p03">Two major trends played a part in this shift. First, prosperity in India and China led to increased food consumption in general, but more specifically to increased meat consumption. Increased meat consumption has led to an increased demand for livestock feed, which has contributed to an overall rise in prices. The second trend relates to biofuels, which are made from a wide variety of crops (such as corn and palm nuts), which increasingly are used to make fuel instead of to feed people.</p>

According to the USDA, about 48.8 million people live in food-insecure households and have reported multiple indications of food access problems. About sixteen million of those have “very low food security,” which means one or more people in the household were hungry at some point over the course of a year due to the inability to afford enough food.

The second type of malnutrition is micronutrient deficiency and relates to inadequate vitamin and mineral intake.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_045">World Hunger. “2011 World Hunger and Poverty Facts and Statistics.” Accessed October 10, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/Learn/world%20hunger%20facts%202002.htm">http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/Learn/world%20hunger%20facts%202002.htm</a>.</span> Even people who are overweight or obese can suffer from this kind of malnutrition if they eat foods that do not meet all of their nutritional needs.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_p01">The adage, “you are what you eat,” seems to be more true today than ever. In recent years, consumers have become more conscientious about the decisions they make in the supermarket. Organically grown food is the fastest growing segment of the food industry. Also, farmers’ markets and chains that are health-food-oriented are thriving in many parts of North America. Shoppers have begun to pay more attention to the effect of food on their health and well-being. That includes not only the kinds of foods that they purchase, but also the manner in which meals are cooked and consumed. The preparation of food can greatly affect its nutritional value. Also, studies have shown that eating at a table with family members or friends can promote both health and happiness.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Family Meals</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s01_p01">In the past, families routinely sat down together to eat dinner. But in recent decades, that comfortable tradition has fallen by the wayside. In 1900, 2 percent of meals were eaten outside of the home. By 2010, that figure had risen to 50 percent.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_060">Mark Hyman, MD, “How Eating at Home Can Save Your Life,” Huffington Post.com, 9 January 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/family-dinner-how_b_806114.html?">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/family-dinner-how _b_806114.html?</a></span> Today, family members often go their own way at mealtimes and when they do sit down together, about three times a week, the meal often lasts less than twenty minutes and is spent eating a microwaved meal in front of a television.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s01_p02">However, recent studies have shown that home-cooked, family meals really matter. Family meals usually lead to the consumption of healthy food packed with nutrition, rather than an intake of empty calories. Other benefits include strengthening familial bonds, improving family communication, and helping young children learn table manners. Increased frequency of family meals has also been associated with certain developmental assets, such as support, boundaries and expectations, commitment to learning, positive values, and social competency.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_061">Rochford, M. “Do Family Meals Still Matter?” <em class="emphasis">Visions: Family and Community Health Sciences</em> (Rutgers University) 21, no. 3 (2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s01_p03">Home-prepared meals provide an opportunity for more balanced and better-portioned meals with fewer calories, sodium, and less saturated fat. When families prepare food together, parents or caregivers can also use the time to teach children about the ways their dietary selections can affect their health.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s01_s01_p01">Teenagers’ dietary choices are influenced by their family’s economic status, the availability of food inside and outside the home, and established traditions. Studies have found links between the prevalence of family meals during adolescence and the establishment of healthy dietary behaviors by young adulthood. Yet, many of today’s teenagers make food selections on their own, which often means eating junk food or fast food on the go.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s01_s01_p02">However, adolescents who regularly consume family meals or have done so in the past are more likely to eat breakfast and to eat more fruits and vegetables. Research has shown that adolescents who have regular meals with their parents are 42 percent less likely to drink alcohol, 50 percent less likely to smoke cigarettes, and 66 percent less likely to use marijuana. Regular family dinners also help protect teens from bulimia, anorexia, and diet pills. In addition, the frequency of family meals was inversely related to lower academic scores and incidents of depression or suicide.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_062">Mark Hyman, MD, “How Eating at Home Can Save Your Life,” Huffington Post.com, 9 January 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/family-dinner-how_b_806114.html?">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/family-dinner-how _b_806114.html?</a></span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s03_p01">Eating fresh, healthy foods not only stimulates your taste buds, but also can improve your quality of life and help you to live longer. As discussed, food fuels your body and helps you to maintain a healthy weight. Nutrition also contributes to longevity and plays an important role in preventing a number of diseases and disorders, from obesity to cardiovascular disease. Some dietary changes can also help to manage certain chronic conditions, including high blood pressure and diabetes. A doctor or a nutritionist can provide guidance to determine the dietary changes needed to ensure and maintain your health.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s03_s01_p01">According to the WHO, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death on the planet.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_063">World Health Organization. “The Top 10 Causes of Death.” Accessed <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/</a>.</span> However, a healthy diet can go a long way toward preventing a number of conditions that contribute to cardiovascular malfunction, including high levels of blood cholesterol and narrowed arteries. As discussed in this text, it is extremely helpful to reduce the intake of trans fat, saturated fat, and sodium. This can considerably lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, or manage further incidents and artery blockages in current heart patients. It is also beneficial to eat a diet high in fiber and to include more omega-3 fatty acids, such as the kind found in mackerel, salmon, and other oily fish.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s03_s02_p01">Blood pressure is the force of blood pumping through the arteries. When pressure levels become too high, it results in a condition known as hypertension, which is asymptomatic but can lead to a number of other problems, including heart attacks, heart failure, kidney failure, and strokes. For people with high blood pressure, it can be beneficial to follow the same recommendations as those for heart patients. First of all, it is crucial to reduce the intake of sodium to prevent pressure levels from continuing to rise. It can also be helpful to increase potassium intake. However, patients should check with a doctor or dietitian first, especially if there are kidney disease concerns.</p>

                <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s03_s02_p02">The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH diet, is highly recommended to lower blood pressure. This program promotes an increased intake of potassium and calcium by emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and limited amounts of lean meat. The DASH diet also decreases the intake of saturated fat and sugar. Studies have shown that blood-pressure patients on the DASH diet were able to reduce their diastolic pressure levels (the lower measurement, which is taken between beats when the heart is relaxed) by up to 5 mmHg regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s03_s03_p01">The rising rates of diabetes have triggered a health crisis in the United States and around the world. In diabetics, the levels of blood glucose, or blood sugar, are too high because of the body’s inability to produce insulin or to use it effectively. There are two types of this disease. Although the causes of Type 1 diabetes are not completely understood, it is known that obesity and genetics are major factors for Type 2.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s06_s03_s03_p02">Nutrition plays a role in lowering the risk of Type 2 diabetes or managing either form of the disease. However, it is a myth that there is one diabetes diet that every patient should follow. Instead, diabetics should keep track of the foods they consume that contain carbohydrates to manage and control blood-glucose levels. Also, a dietitian can help patients create a specific meal plan that fits their preferences, lifestyle, and health goals.</p>

According to the National Institutes of Health, over two-thirds of American adults are overweight, and one in three is obese. Obesity in particular puts people at risk for a host of complications, including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and some forms of cancer. The more overweight a person is, the greater his or her risk of developing life-threatening complications. There is no single cause of obesity and no single way to treat it. However, a healthy, nutritious diet is generally the first step, including consuming more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats and dairy products.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_064">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health. “Overweight and Obesity Statistics.” <em class="emphasis">NIH Publication No. 04-4158</em>.

Nutrition is very important in managing end-stage renal disease, and a patient with this condition should discuss a meal plan with a dietitian and physician. Certain macro- and micronutrients will need to be monitored closely, including protein, potassium, sodium, and phosphorus. Kidney patients must also keep track of their caloric intake and dietitians may recommend consuming more fast-releasing carbohydrates and low-saturated fats to boost the number of calories consumed each day.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_p01">In the past, people’s culture and location determined the foods they ate and the manner in which they prepared their meals. For example, in the Middle East, wheat was a staple grain and was used to make flatbread and porridge, while halfway around the world in Mesoamerica, maize was the staple crop and was used to make tortillas and tamales. Today, most people have access to a wide variety of food and can prepare them any way they choose. However, customs and traditions still strongly influence diet and cuisine in most areas of the world.</p>
    <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Comparing Diets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_p01">There are a multitude of diets across the globe, in all regions and cultures. Each is influenced by the traditions of the past, along with the produce and livestock available. Local tastes, agricultural economics, and incomes still have a profound effect on what many people eat around the world. In this section, you will read a few examples of cuisines in different countries and regions, demonstrating differences in preferences. We will also compare common dietary choices in each region for a key meal—breakfast.</p>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">North America</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s01_p01">The people of the United States and Canada consume a wide variety of food. Throughout both countries, people enjoy eating all kinds of cuisine from barbecue, pizza, peanut butter sandwiches, and pie to sushi, tacos, chow mein, and roti (an Indian flatbread). This is partly due to the influence of immigration. As people emmigrated to North America, they brought their dietary differences with them. In the 1800s, for example, Italian immigrants continued to cook spaghetti, pesto, and other cultural dishes after arriving in the United States. Today, Italian cuisine is enjoyed by many Americans from all backgrounds.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s01_p02">The variety of North American cuisine has also been impacted by regional variations. For example, fried chicken, cornbread, and sweet tea are popular in the southern states, while clam chowder, lobster rolls, and apple cider are enjoyed in New England. Also, as more people seek to support sustainable agriculture, locally grown crops and whole-food cooking practices often factor into what Americans eat and how they eat it.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s01_s01_p01">Meals can vary widely from one region of the world to another. Therefore, it can be interesting and informative to compare the choices made for a particular meal around the globe. Throughout this section, we will explore the kinds of foods that people consume as they begin their day. Breakfast is a vital meal in any part of the world because it breaks the long overnight fast. An adequate breakfast also provides fuel for the first part of the day and helps improve concentration and energy levels.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s01_s01_p02">Let’s begin with breakfast in North America. On weekdays, North Americans often eat breakfast in a hurry or on the go. Therefore, many people choose breakfast foods that are quick and easy to prepare or can be eaten during the trip to school or the office. As a result, breakfast cereals with milk are extremely popular, and also oatmeal, toast, or bagels. However, on the weekends, some people spend a longer time enjoying a hearty breakfast or going out for brunch. Typical choices emphasize hot foods and include egg dishes, such as omelettes and scrambled or fried eggs, along with pancakes, waffles, french toast, bacon or sausage, and orange juice, coffee, or tea to drink.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s02_p01">Both Central America and South America feature cuisines with rich Latin flavors. In addition, rice and corn are staples in both and form the basis for many dishes. Both regions are also affected by the mixture of influences from the native populations and the cultural traditions brought by Spanish and Portuguese immigrants during the 1600s and beyond.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s02_p02">South America has a diverse population, which is reflected in dietary choices across the continent. The northwestern region boasts some of the most exotic food in Latin America. In northeastern South America, many dishes feature a contrast of sweet and salty tastes, including raisins, prunes, capers, and olives. Also, rice grown in the area and seafood off the coast are key ingredients in South American-style paella. The north central part of the continent reflects a Spanish influence. Many of the dominant spices—cumin, oregano, cinnamon, and anise—came from Spain, along with orange and lime juices, wine, and olive oil. The south is cattle country and the locals enjoy grass-fed beef cooked in the form of asados, which are large cuts roasted in a campfire. Another popular meat dish is parrilladas, which are thick steaks grilled over oak.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_065">Cooking Light. “South American Cuisine.” © 2012 Time Inc.

This area combines a variety of culinary traditions derived from the native Maya and Aztec populations, arrivals from Spain, and African and Latin-influenced neighbors along the Caribbean. In this region of the world, tamales are common. Spicy seasonings, including hot chili peppers, are also very popular.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s02_s01_p01">Typical foods in South and Central America include quinoa, which is a grain-like crop that is cultivated for its edible seeds. Quinoa has a high protein and fiber content, is gluten-free, and is particulary tasty cooked in pilafs. Another popular grain product is the tortilla, which is a flatbread made from wheat or corn. Tortillas are used to make a number of dishes, including burritos, enchiladas, and tacos. Fruits and vegetables that are common in Mexico, Central America, and South America include corn, avocados, yucca, peppers, potatoes, mangoes, and papayas. Rice, beans, and a soft cheese known as queso fresco are common to the cuisine in this area of the world as well.</p>

Other popular breakfast dishes include pan dulce (a sweetened bread), along with fried plantains, and a spicy sausage called chorizo. The typical beverage is coffee, which is available in many forms, including café con leche (which is sweetened with lots of milk) and café de olla (with cinnamon and brown sugar). Hot chocolate is also popular and tends to be thick, rich, and flavored with spices such as cinnamon or achiote. In the Yucatan region, huevos motulenos are prepared by spreading refried beans onto fresh tortillas with fried eggs, peas, chopped ham, and cheese.</p>

The diet in Great Britain is different from what people typically consume in Germany, for example. However, across the continent, meat dishes are prominent, along with an emphasis on sauces. Potatoes, wheat, and dairy products are also staples of the European diet.</p>

For example, the people of northern Italy tend to rely on dairy products such as butter, cream, and cheeses made from cow’s milk, because the land is flatter and better suited to raising cattle. In southern Italy, there is greater reliance on olive oil than butter, and cheeses are more likely to be made from sheep’s milk.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_066">Cooking Light. “Regional Italian Cuisine.” © 2012 Time Inc.

Frites, or French fries, are cut in different shapes and fried in different fats, depending on the region. Fresh-baked bread is also found across the nation from the skinny baguettes of Paris to the sourdough breads in other parts of the country.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s03_s04_p01">In some countries, such as France, Italy, and Belgium, coffee and bread are common breakfast foods. However, the people of Great Britain and Ireland tend to enjoy a bigger breakfast with oatmeal or cold cereal, along with meats like bacon and sausage, plus eggs and toast. Tea is also popular in this area, not only for breakfast, but throughout the day. The continental-style breakfast is most commonly associated with France and includes fresh-baked croissants, toast, or a rich French pastry called brioche, along with a hot cup of tea, coffee, or café au lait.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s04_p01">The continent of Africa is home to many different countries and cultural groups. This diversity is reflected in the cuisine and dietary choices of the African people. Traditionally, various African cusines combine locally grown cereals and grains, with fruits and vegetables. In some regions, dairy products dominate, while in others meat and poultry form the basis of many dishes.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Ethiopia</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s04_s01_p01">Ethiopia, located along the Horn of Africa, is one of the few African countries never colonized by a foreign nation prior to the modern era. So, outside influences on the culture were limited. Religious influences from Jewish, Islamic, and Catholic traditions played a larger role on the shaping of Ethiopian cuisine, because of the need to adhere to different dietary restrictions. For example, approximately half of Ethiopians are Muslim and must abstain from eating pork or using spices and nuts to flavor dishes. Ethiopia is also known for dishes that use local herbs and spices, including fenugreek, cumin, cardamom, coriander, saffron, and mustard. Many dishes also reflect a history of vegetarian cooking since meat was not always readily available.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_069">Cooking Light. “Ethiopian Tastes.” © 2012 Time Inc.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s04_s01_p02">In addition, Ethiopians use their hands to eat. First, diners tear off pieces of injera, a spongy, tangy flatbread made from teff flour. Then, they use the pieces as utensils to scoop up vegetables, legumes, and meats from a communal plate.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_070">Ethiopian Restaurant.com. “Injera.” © 2004–2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ethiopianrestaurant.com/injera.html">http://www.ethiopianrestaurant.com/injera.html</a></span> Teff is a grass that grows in the highlands of Ethiopia and is a staple of the diet.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s04_s02_p01">Stretching from mountains in the north to the Congo River, Central Africa primarily features traditional cuisine. Meals are focused on certain staples, including cassava, which is a mashed root vegetable, and also plantains, peanuts, and chili peppers. In West Africa, which includes the Sahara Desert and Atlantic coast, the cuisine features dishes made from tomatoes, onions, chili peppers, and palm nut oil. Popular dishes in both regions include stews and porridges, such as ground nut stew made from peanuts, and also fufu, a paste made from cassava or maize.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s04_s03_p01">African breakfast choices are strongly influenced by the colonial heritage of a region. The people of West Africa typically enjoy the French continental-style breakfast. However, in the eastern and southern parts of the continent, the traditional English breakfast is more common. In North Africa, breakfast is likely to include tea or coffee, with breads made from sorghum or millet. In East and West Africa, a common breakfast dish is uji, a thick porridge made from cassava, millet, rice, or corn. Kitoza is a delicacy made from dried strips of beef that are eaten with porridge in Madagascar. In Algeria, French bread, jam, and coffee is a typical breakfast. The people of Cameroon eat beignets, which is a doughnut eaten with beans or dipped in a sticky, sugary liquid called bouilli.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s05_p01">Asia is a massive continent that encompasses the countries of the Middle East, parts of Russia, and the island nations of the southeast. Due to this diversity, Asian cuisine can be broken down into several regional styles, including South Asia, which is represented for our purposes here by India, and East Asia which is represented for our purposes by China, Korea, and Japan. Even with this variety, the Asian nations have some dietary choices in common. For example, rice is a staple used in many dishes across the continent.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s05_s01_p01">In India, there is much variety between the different provinces. The nation’s many kinds of regional cuisines can date back thousands of years and are influenced by geography, food availability, economics, and local customs. However, vegetarian diets are common across the nation for religious reasons, among others. As a result, Indian dishes are often based on rice, lentils, and vegetables, rather than meat or poultry. Indian cooking also features spicy seasonings, including curries, mustard oil, cumin, chili pepper, garlic, ginger, and garam masala, which is a blend of several spices.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_071">Curry Dishes.com. “Guide to Easy Indian Recipes, Curry Recipes and Curry Spices.” © 2009. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.currydishes.com/">http://www.currydishes.com/</a>.</span> India is also known for its breads, including the flatbreads roti and chapati. Dishes that are popular not only in India but around the world include samosa, a potato-stuffed pastry; shahi paneer, a creamy curry dish made out of soft cheese and tomato sauce; and chana masala, chickpeas in curry sauce.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_072">Food-India.com. “Your Guide to Indian Food.” © 2003–2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.food-india.com/">http://www.food-india.com/</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s05_s02_p01">China has the world’s most sizable population. As a result, there are many different culinary traditions across this vast country, which is usually divided into eight distinct cuisine regions. For example, Cantonese cuisine, which is also known as Guangdong, features light, mellow dishes that are often made with sauces, including sweet-and-sour sauce and oyster sauce. Cantonese-style cuisine has been popularized in Chinese restaurants around the world. Another cuisine is known as Zhejiang, which is often shortened to Zhe, and originates from a province in southern China. It features dishes made from seafood, freshwater fish, and bamboo shoots.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_073">eChinacities.com. “China’s Eight Cuisines Revealed and How to Identify Them.” ©2008–2011 <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.echinacities.com/expat-corner/china-s-8-cuisines-revealed-and-how-to-indentify-them.html">http://www.echinacities.com/expat-corner/china-s-8-cuisines-revealed -and-how-to-indentify-them.html</a></span> Key ingredients that are used in several, but not all, of the different regions include rice, tofu, ginger, and garlic.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s05_s02_p02">Chinese use chopsticks as utensils. These small tapered sticks can be made from a variety of materials, including wood, plastic, bamboo, metal, bone, and ivory. Both chopsticks are held in one hand, between the thumb and fingers, and are used to pick up food.</p>

Commonly-used ingredients include sesame oil, soy sauce, bean paste, garlic, ginger, and red pepper. Most meals feature a number of side dishes, along with a bowl of steam-cooked, short grain rice. Kimchi, a fermented cabbage dish, is the most common side dish served in Korea and is consumed at almost every meal. Another signature dish, bibimbap, is a bowl of white rice topped with sautéed vegetables and chili pepper paste and can include egg or sliced meat. Bulgogi consists of marinated, barbecued beef.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_074">Korea Tourism Organization. “Food in Korea.” Accessed October 10, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://visitkorea.or.kr/enu/1051_Food.jsp">http://visitkorea.or.kr/enu/1051_Food.jsp</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s05_s04_p01">As in other parts of Asia, rice is a staple in Japan, along with seafood, which is plentiful on this island nation. Other commonly-used ingredients include noodles, teriyaki sauce, dried seaweed, mushrooms and other vegetables, meat, and miso, which is soybean paste. Some favorite foods include the raw fish dishes sashimi and sushi, which are not only popular in Japan, but are also around the world. Typical beverages include green tea and also sake, which is a wine made of fermented rice.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_075">Web MD. “Diets of the World: The Japanese Diet.” © 2005–2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/diets-of-world-japanese-diet">http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/diets-of-world-japanese-diet</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s05_s04_p02">The traditional table setting in Japan includes placing a bowl of rice on the left and a bowl of miso soup on the right side. Behind the rice and the soup are three flat plates which hold the accompanying side dishes. Similar to China, chopsticks are used in Japan and are generally placed at the front of the table setting. At school or work, many Japanese people eat out of a bento lunch box, which is a single-portion takeout or home-cooked meal. Bento boxes typically include rice, fish or meat, and cooked or pickled vegetables.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s05_s05_p01">Middle Eastern cuisine encompasses a number of different cooking styles from Asian countries along the Mediterranean, as well as from North African nations, such as Egypt and Libya. In this part of the world, lamb is the most commonly consumed meat and is prepared in a number of ways, including as a shish kebab, in a stew, or spit-roasted. However, kosher beef, kosher poultry, and fish are eaten as well. Other staples include the fruits and vegetables that grow in the hills of many Middle Eastern countries, such as dates, olives, figs, apricots, cucumber, cabbage, potatoes, and eggplant. Common grains include couscous, millet, rice, and bulghur. Popular dishes include Syrian baba ganoush, which is pureed eggplant, and kibbeh, or lamb with bulghur wheat, from Lebanon.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_076">Saveur. “Middle Eastern Recipes.” Accessed December 5, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.saveur.com/solrSearchResults.jsp?fq=Cuisine:Middle%5C%20Eastern&amp;sitesection=recipes">http://www.saveur.com/solrSearchResults.jsp?fq=Cuisine:Middle\%20Eastern&amp; sitesection=recipes</a>.</span> A flatbread called pita served with hummus, or pureed chickpeas, is another popular dish in this region of the world.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s05_s05_p02">Most people who reside in the Arab countries of the Middle East are Muslim, which can affect their diet. Many Muslims do not consume alcohol or pork. They also observe certain diet-related religious traditions, such as a daytime fast during the month of Ramadan. Other residents of the Middle East include Jews and Christians, and their traditions also affect what foods they eat and how they prepare it. For example, many Jews in Israel keep kosher and follow a set of dietary laws that impact food choices, storage, and preparation.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s05_s06_p01">To continue the comparison of breakfast around the world, let’s examine the first meal of the day in many parts of Asia. In India, the first meal of the day commonly includes eggs scrambled with spices, potatoes, and onions, as well as fresh fruit and yogurt. Breakfast in China often consists of rice complemented by vegetables, meat, or fish. In Korea, a traditional breakfast would include soup made of either beef ribs or pork intestines, a selection of bread and pastries, rice, and kimchi, which is believed to promote intestinal health. Breakfast in Japan does not greatly differ from any other meal. It typically consists of a bowl of steamed white rice, a small piece of fish, a bowl of miso soup with tofu, vegetables, green tea, and occasionally pickled plums called umeboshi. Hot bowls of noodles in broth topped with pork slices, scallions, and bamboo shoots are also common.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s01_s05_s06_p02">Congee is a common breakfast food across Asia. This dish is a porridge made of rice that is consumed in a number of Asian countries, including Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, and Bangladesh. Congee can be prepared both savory and sweet and contain a variety of ingredients, usually meats, vegetables, and herbs. It can be eaten alone or served as a side dish.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s02_p01">Around the globe, people enjoy different foods and different flavors. In some cultures, the main dishes are meat-based, while others focus on plant-based meals. You can also find different staples in different regions of the world, including rice, potatoes, pasta, corn, beans, root vegetables, and many kinds of grains. Different flavors are also popular on different parts of the planet, from sweet to salty to sour to spicy.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s02_s01_p01">People tend to eat what grows or lives nearby. For example, people in coastal areas tend to consume more seafood, while those in inland areas tend to structure their diet around locally-grown crops, such as potatoes or wheat. In many developing countries, a large part of the diet is composed of cereal grains, starchy roots, and legumes. However, a number of common staples are consumed worldwide, including rice, corn, wheat, potatoes, cassava, and beans.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s02_s02_p01">In addition to regional dissimilarities in diets, income also plays a major role in what foods people eat and how they prepare them. The average global calorie consumption has increased to record levels in recent years. This is a consequence of rising incomes, which have allowed consumers in many regions to expand both the variety and the quantity of food they eat. Among developing countries, the daily intake of calories per person rose by nearly 25 percent from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_077">US Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service. “Diets Around the World: How the Menu Varies.” Last modified October 14, 2004. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/info/agexporter/2000/Apr/diets.htm">http://www.fas.usda.gov/info/agexporter/2000/Apr/diets.htm</a>.</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup> <span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_078">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Caloric Consumption on the Rise in the United States, Particularly Among Women.” NCHS Press Room, February 5, 2004. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/04news/calorie.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/04news/calorie.htm</a>.</span> People in the western world were able to increase their consumption of meat and poultry, fruits and vegetables, and fats and oils.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s02_s03_p01">People from different parts of the world consume their food in different ways and what is common in one country may be considered impolite in another. For example, in some areas people eat with their fingers, while in others using a fork is much more acceptable. In some regions of the world, people slurp their soup, while in others they quietly sip it. In some places, diners eat off of individual plates, while in others people sit at a table with a large communal plate from which everyone eats.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s07_s02_s03_p02">No matter where you travel, you will find that food production, purchase, and preparation affect all facets of life, from health and economics to religion and culture. Therefore, it is vital for people from all walks of life to consider the choices they make regarding food, and how those decisions affect not only their bodies, but also their world. Alice Waters, an influential chef and founder of the nonprofit program Edible Schoolyard, as well as an advocate for sustainable production and consumption, has said, “Remember food is precious. Good food can only come from good ingredients. Its proper price includes the cost of preserving the environment and paying fairly for the labor of the people who produce it. Food should never be taken for granted.”<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_080">Waters, A. “The Art of Eating.” PlanetGreen.com.
