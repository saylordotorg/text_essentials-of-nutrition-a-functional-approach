        <h3 class="title">Big Idea</h3>
        <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s00_p01">Eating foods such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices that are high in antioxidants can help prevent cell damage and promote health.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s00_p02">Government trickery and greed are a big part of the history of the woody, bittersweet nutmeg people sprinkle in their eggnog and add to their pumpkin pie.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s00_p03">Arabs originally controlled the lucrative nutmeg trade. Run Island, part of the Banda archipelago in the Maluku province of Indonesia, and (for a while) the sole source of nutmeg, remained a well-kept secret under their control. Then, in 1521, the Portuguese conquered the southern region of Malay in Indonesia and discovered the island.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s00_p04">Control of this nutmeg source switched hands rapidly from this point on. Although the Portuguese claimed ownership for a moment, the Spaniards were quick to take over. In the seventeenth century, the Dutch East India Company invaded the Band Islands. They then ran plantation estates on Run Island and actively patrolled the sea in war vessels to discourage the stealing of seeds from <em class="emphasis">Myristica fragrans</em>. They went so far as to track the movement of pigeons and other animals that might unwittingly transport the seeds elsewhere, and they burned any trees found off of Run Island.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s00_p05">The battles over Run Island had one important motivation: money. Trade was lucrative in the seventeenth century because nutmeg was valued as a curative for stomach ailments, as an aphrodisiac, and as a healer of the liver. The spice even had a reputation for curing the plague, which might have worked—wearing a clove of it around the neck may have deterred fleas and other disease carriers. Buyers were also well aware of nutmeg’s hallucinogenic properties and used it in high doses as a psychoactive drug. Its price was astronomically high and kept so by the Dutch, who burned their own nutmeg warehouses down to assure the laws of supply and demand did not lower the spice’s value.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s00_p06">During the Napoleanic wars, while the Dutch were battling the French, the British slipped onto Run Island, stole <em class="emphasis">Myristica fragras</em> seeds, and successfully grew the tree on plantations on the island of Grenada. Today, Grenada, also known as the “Isle of Spice,” produces about one-third of the world’s supply, which is why its flag boasts a clove of nutmeg.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s00_p07">Our ancestors were probably right to value nutmeg for its curative properties. While it does not actually cure disease outright, nutmeg contains a variety of antioxidants, including phenolic compounds, lignans, and eugenol. Foods rich in antioxidants have been touted as preventative and curative, and some believe they delay certain aspects of the aging process. While we are no longer fighting over nutmeg’s production and sale, we are waging a fierce debate about the lack of scientific proof of these believed benefits.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s00_p08">The “antioxidant hypothesis”—the educated guess that antioxidant chemicals protect against chronic disease—has existed for decades. Despite thousands of studies conducted on the health benefits of particular antioxidants, there is little evidence supporting the idea that they singularly prevent disease, reduce the effects of aging, or promote health. It is the <em class="emphasis">combination</em> of antioxidants, phytochemicals, and nutrient-rich foods that achieves these end goals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s00_p09">Nutmeg has been shown in animal and laboratory studies to act as an antimicrobial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory agent. It has protected against liver damage and stimulated male sexual activity in rats. However, none of these effects has been scientifically shown to occur in humans. On the other hand, nutmeg has proven effective as a psychoactive drug when taken in high doses.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s00_p10">In this chapter, you will learn there is no miracle food or supplement. The debate over the nutmeg’s effectiveness as an antioxidant—and over the effects of antioxidants in general—is proof of this. You will also learn that plant chemicals can affect the body in many different ways, depending on the type of chemical and the dosage. Different antioxidants are believed to have different functions, and those functions are sometimes interdependent or dependent on the amount of nutrient-rich foods you eat.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_p01">In mainstream advertising you may have heard that antioxidants can extend your life by preventing disease and slowing the aging process. But what are antioxidants? And how do they work in the body? Is there any truth to the marketers’ claims? Are there better sources than supplements for antioxidants? After reading this chapter you will be able to answer these questions, and your new knowledge will assist you in making dietary decisions to optimize your health.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_p02">Keep in mind as you read there is no scientific evidence that antioxidants <em class="emphasis">singularly</em> provide bodily benefits, but there is evidence that certain benefits are achieved by ingesting antioxidants as part of a balanced, healthy, nutrient-rich diet. This is to say antioxidants may go a long way toward preventing damage, but other nutrients are necessary to repair damage and sustain health. No one chemical acts alone!</p>
    <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Atom</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p01">Before we can talk about the nutritional value of antioxidants we must review a few chemistry basics, starting with the atom. Cells are the basic building blocks of life, but <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">atoms</a><span class="glossdef">The basic building blocks of all matter, living and nonliving.</span></span> are the basic building blocks of all matter, living and nonliving.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p02">The structural elements of an atom are protons (positively charged), neutrons (no charge), and electrons (negatively charged). Protons and neutrons are contained in the dense nucleus of the atom; the nucleus thus has a positive charge. Because opposites attract, electrons are attracted to this nucleus and move around it in the electron cloud.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p03">Electrons contain energy, and this energy is stored within the charge and movement of electrons and the bonds atoms make with one another. However, this energy is not always stable, depending on the number of electrons within an atom.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p04">Atoms are more stable when their electrons orbit in pairs. An atom with an odd number of electrons must have an unpaired electron. In most cases, these unpaired electrons are used to create chemical bonds. A chemical bond is the attractive force between atoms and contains potential energy. By bonding, electrons find pairs and chemicals become part of a molecule.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p05">Bond formation and bond breaking are chemical reactions that involve the movement of electrons between atoms. These chemical reactions occur continuously in the body and many of them will be discussed in more detail in <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch10#zimmerman_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "Nutrients Important for Metabolism and Blood Function"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p06">In <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch03#zimmerman_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Nutrition and the Human Body"</a> we reviewed how glucose breaks down into water and carbon dioxide as part of cellular respiration. The energy released by breaking those bonds is used to form molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Recall how during this process electrons are extracted from glucose in a stepwise manner and transferred to other molecules. Occasionally electrons “escape” and, instead of completing the cellular respiration cycle, are transferred to an oxygen molecule. Oxygen (a molecule with two atoms) with one unpaired electron is known as superoxide (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.1</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p07">Atoms and molecules such as superoxide that have unpaired electrons are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">free radicals</a><span class="glossdef">Highly reactive atoms with unpaired electrons.</span></span>; those containing oxygen are more specifically referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reactive oxygen species</a><span class="glossdef">Molecules containing oxygen that have unpaired electrons and are highly reactive.</span></span>. The unpaired electron in free radicals destabilizes them, making them highly reactive. Other reactive oxygen species include hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p08">The reactivity of free radicals is what poses a threat to macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and fatty acids. Free radicals can cause chain reactions that ultimately damage cells. For example, a superoxide molecule may react with a fatty acid and steal one of its electrons. The fatty acid then becomes a free radical that can react with another fatty acid nearby. As this chain reaction continues, the permeability and fluidity of cell membranes changes, proteins in cell membranes experience decreased activity, and receptor proteins undergo changes in structure that either alter or stop their function. If receptor proteins designed to react to insulin levels undergo a structural change it can negatively effect glucose uptake.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Body’s Defense</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_p01">Free radical development is unavoidable, but human bodies have adapted by setting up and maintaining defense mechanisms that reduce their impact. The body’s two major defense systems are free radical detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant chemicals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_p02">Free radical detoxifying enzyme systems are responsible for protecting the insides of cells from free radical damage. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">antioxidant</a><span class="glossdef">Any molecule that can block free radicals from stealing electrons.</span></span> is any molecule that can block free radicals from stealing electrons; antioxidants act both inside and outside of cells.</p>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Free Radical Detoxifying Enzymes</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s01_p01">The three major enzyme systems and the chemical reactions they catalyze are:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Superoxide Dismutases (SOD).</strong> These enzymes have either a manganese, copper, or zinc cofactor, which is essential for their free radical detoxifying activity. During SOD-mediated enzymatic catalysis, two superoxides are converted into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) is still considered a reactive oxygen species, but it is markedly less reactive than a superoxide. SOD enzymes are one of the fastest enzymes known, and they are also inducible, meaning that the higher their exposure to superoxides the greater their number and detoxifying activity.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Catalase.</strong> This enzyme contains iron as a cofactor and converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, thereby finishing the detoxification reaction started by SOD. In cells, catalase enzymes are found in high numbers and continuously patrol for hydrogen peroxide molecules. Catalase is highly efficient and is capable of destroying millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules per second.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Glutathione Peroxidases.</strong> The majority of enzymes within this family are dependent on the micronutrient selenium. Similar to catalase, these enzymes convert hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Antioxidant Chemicals</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p01">Antioxidants are broadly classified as either hydrophilic (water soluble) or hydrophobic (lipid soluble) chemicals, and this classification determines where they act in the body. Hydrophilic antioxidants act in the cytosol of cells or in extracellular fluids such as blood; hydrophobic antioxidants are largely responsible for protecting cell membranes from free radical damage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p02">The body can synthesize some antioxidants, but others must be obtained from the diet.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Antioxidant Chemicals the Body Synthesizes</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_s01_p01">There are two antioxidant chemicals that the body synthesizes. They are:</p>

                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Glutathione.</strong> This molecule is composed of three amino acids and is found in high concentrations in cells. The cysteine amino acid of glutathione contains a sulfur group that can donate an electron to a free radical, thereby stabilizing it. After glutathione has lost its electron, it is regenerated enzymatically so that it can perform its antioxidant function once again.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Uric Acid.</strong> This molecule is a metabolic intermediate in the breakdown of nucleotides such as adenine, which is found in DNA and RNA, among other macromolecules. It circulates at high concentrations in the blood and disables circulating free radicals. However, uric acid is a good example of the adage “it’s the dose that makes the poison” because high concentrations in the blood can cause gout, a painful joint disorder.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Body’s Offense</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p01">While our bodies have acquired multiple defenses against free radicals, we also use free radicals to support its functions. For example, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of free radicals to kill pathogens. First, immune cells engulf an invader (such as a bacterium), then they expose it to free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane. The invader is thus neutralized.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p02">Scientific studies also suggest hydrogen peroxide acts as a signaling molecule that calls immune cells to injury sites, meaning free radicals may aid with tissue repair when you get cut.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p03">Free radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as well. The thyroid gland synthesizes its own hydrogen peroxide, which is required for the production of thyroid hormone. Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which are free radicals containing nitrogen, have been found to interact with proteins in cells to produce signaling molecules. The free radical nitric oxide has been found to help dilate blood vessels and act as a chemical messenger in the brain.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p04">By acting as signaling molecules, free radicals are involved in the control of their own synthesis, stress responses, regulation of cell growth and death, and metabolism.</p>

            <p class="para">The body creates free radicals through the normal processes of metabolism. When the amount of free radicals exceeds the body’s ability to eliminate or neutralize them, an oxidative imbalance results.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s04_p01">Substances and energy sources from the environment can add to or accelerate the production of free radicals within the body. Exposure to excessive sunlight, ozone, smoke, heavy metals, ionizing radiation, asbestos, and other toxic chemicals increase the amount of free radicals in the body. They do so by being free radicals themselves or by adding energy that provokes electrons to move between atoms. Excessive exposure to environmental sources of free radicals can contribute to disease by overwhelming the free radical detoxifying systems and those processes involved in repairing oxidative damage.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s05_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Oxidative stress</a><span class="glossdef">An imbalance in any cell, tissue, or organ between the amount of free radicals and the capablilities of its detoxifying and repair systems.</span></span> refers to an imbalance in any cell, tissue, or organ between the amount of free radicals and the capablilities of the detoxifying and repair systems. Sustained oxidative damage results only under conditions of oxidative stress—when the detoxifying and repair systems are insufficient. Free radical-induced damage, when left unrepaired, destroys lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA, and can contribute to disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a contributing factor to cancer, atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries), arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, emphysema, and cataracts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01_s05_p02">Aging is a process that is genetically determined but modulated by factors in the environment. In the process of aging, tissue function declines. The idea that oxidative stress is the primary contributor to age-related tissue decline has been around for decades, and it is true that tissues accumulate free radical-induced damage as we age. Recent scientific evidence slightly modifies this theory by suggesting oxidative stress is not the initial trigger for age-related decline of tissues; it is suggested that the true culprit is progressive dysfunction of metabolic processes, which leads to increases in free radical production, thus influencing the stress response of tissues as they age.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_p01">The market is flooded with advertisements for “super antioxidant” supplements teeming with molecules that block free radical production, stimulate the immune system, prevent cancer, and reduce the signs of aging. Based on the antioxidant-supplement industry’s success, the general public appears to believe these health claims. However, these claims are not backed by scientific evidence; rather, there is some evidence suggesting supplements can actually cause harm.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_p02">While scientists have found evidence supporting the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods as a method of reducing the risk of chronic disease, there is no “miracle cure;” no pill or supplement alone can provide the same benefits as a healthy diet. Remember, it is the combination of antioxidants and other nutrients in healthy foods that is beneficial.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_p03">In this section, we will review how particular antioxidants function in the body, learn how they work together to protect the body against free radicals, and explore the best nutrient-rich dietary sources of antioxidants.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Antioxidant Vitamins</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p01">One dietary source of antioxidants is vitamins. In our discussion of antioxidant vitamins, we will focus on vitamins E, C, and A.</p>
        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Vitamin E Functions and Health Benefits</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p01">Vitamin E is actually eight chemically similar substances, of which alpha-tocopherol appears to be the most potent antioxidant. Alpha-tocopherol and vitamin E’s other constituents are fat-soluble and primarily responsible for protecting cell membranes against lipid destruction caused by free radicals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p02">After alpha-tocopherol interacts with a free radical it is no longer capable of acting as an antioxidant unless it is enzymatically regenerated. Vitamin C helps to regenerate some of the alpha-tocopherol, but the remainder is eliminated from the body. Therefore, to maintain vitamin E levels, you ingest it as part of your diet.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p03">In addition to its antioxidant functions, vitamin E, mainly as alpha-tocopherol, can change the functions of proteins in cells, plays a role in the operations of the immune system, enhances the dilation of blood vessels, and inhibits blood clot formation. Despite vitamin E’s numerous beneficial functions when taken in recommended amounts, large studies do not support the idea that taking higher doses of this vitamin will increase its power to prevent or reduce disease risk.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_001">Goodman, M., Bostlick RM, Kucuk O, Jones DP. 2011.

                <h2 class="title editable block">Cardiovascular Disease</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s01_s01_p01">Recall from <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch05#zimmerman_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Lipids"</a> that low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) transport cholesterol and other lipids from the liver to the rest of the body. LDLs are often referred to as “bad cholesterol,” as an elevation in their levels in the blood is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Oxidation of the lipids and proteins in LDLs causes them to stick to the walls of arteries and this contributes to the development of fatty streaks and, eventually, plaque, which hardens the arteries. Hardening of the arteries, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">atherosclerosis</a><span class="glossdef">A progressive hardening of the arteries that can lead to a heart attack.</span></span> can lead to a heart attack.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s01_s01_p02">Vitamin E reduces the oxidation of LDLs, and it was therefore hypothesized that vitamin E supplements would protect against atherosclerosis. However, large clinical trials have not consistently found evidence to support this hypothesis. In fact, in the “Women’s Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen Study,” postmenopausal women who took 400 international units (264 milligrams) of vitamin E and 500 milligrams of vitamin C twice per day had higher death rates from all causes.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_003">Waters, D.D. et al. “Effects of Hormone Replacement Therapy and Antioxidant Vitamin Supplements on Coronary Atherosclerosis in Postmenopausal Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial.” <em class="emphasis">JAMA</em> 288, no. 19 (2002): 2432–40. doi: 10.1001/jama.288.19.2432</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s01_s01_p03">Other studies have not confirmed the association between increased vitamin E intake from supplements and increased mortality.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s01_s03_p02">In the dry form, deposits form in the macula; the deposits may or may not directly impair vision, at least in the early stages of the disease. In the wet form, abnormal blood vessel growth in the macula causes vision loss. Clinical trials evaluating the effects of vitamin E supplements on AMD and cataracts (clouding of the lens of an eye) did not consistently observe a decreased risk for either. However, scientists do believe vitamin E in combination with other antioxidants such as zinc and copper may slow the progression of macular degeneration in people with early-stage disease.</p>

The UL for vitamin E is set at 1,500 international units for adults. There is some evidence that taking vitamin E supplements at high doses has negative effects on health. As mentioned, vitamin E inhibits blood clotting and a few clinical trials have found that people taking vitamin E supplements have an increased risk of stroke.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p01">Vitamin C, also commonly called ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble micronutrient essential in the diet for humans, although most other mammals can readily synthesize it. Vitamin C’s ability to easily donate electrons makes it a highly effective antioxidant. It is effective in scavenging reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, and many other free radicals. It protects lipids both by disabling free radicals and by aiding in the regeneration of vitamin E.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p02">In addition to its role as an antioxidant, vitamin C is a required part of several enzymes involved in the synthesis of collagen, signaling molecules in the brain, some hormones, and amino acids. Vitamin C levels in the body are affected by the amount in the diet, which influences how much is absorbed and how much the kidney allows to be excreted, such that the higher the intake, the more vitamin C is excreted. Vitamin C is not stored in any significant amount in the body, but once it has reduced a free radical, it is very effectively regenerated and therefore it can exist in the body as a functioning antioxidant for many weeks.</p>

Overall, higher dietary intakes of vitamin C (via food intake, not supplements), are linked to decreased disease risk. A review of multiple studies published in the April 2009 issue of the <em class="emphasis">Archives of Internal Medicine</em> concludes there is moderate scientific evidence supporting the idea that higher dietary vitamin C intakes are correlated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude that taking vitamin C supplements influences cardiovascular disease risk.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_007">Mente, A., et al. “A Systematic Review of the Evidence Supporting a Causal Link between Dietary Factors and Coronary Heart Disease.” <em class="emphasis">Arch Intern Med</em> 169, no.7 (2009): 659–69. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/169/7/659">http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/169/7/659</a>.</span></p>

In a study involving over twenty thousand participants, people with the highest levels of circulating vitamin C had a 42 percent decreased risk for having a stroke.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_008">Myint, P.K. et al. “Plasma Vitamin C Concentrations Predict Risk of Incident Stroke Over 10 Y[ears] in 20,649 Participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer, Norfolk Prospective Population Study.” <em class="emphasis">Am J Clin Nutr</em> 87, no.1 (2008): 64–69. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/87/1/64.long">http://www.ajcn.org/content/87/1/64.long</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s02_s02_p01">There is some evidence that a higher vitamin C intake is linked to a reduced risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, colon, and lung, but not all studies confirm this is true. As with the studies on cardiovascular disease, the reduced risk of cancer is the result of eating foods rich in vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, not from taking vitamin C supplements. In these studies, the specific protective effects of vitamin C cannot be separated from the many other beneficial chemicals in fruits and vegetables.</p>

Many others take vitamin C supplements routinely to prevent colds. Contrary to this popular practice, however, there is no good evidence that vitamin C prevents a cold. A review of more than fifty years of studies published in 2004 in the <em class="emphasis">Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</em> concludes that taking vitamin C routinely does not prevent colds in most people, but it does slightly reduce cold severity and duration. Moreover, taking megadoses (up to 4 grams per day) at the onset of a cold provides no benefits.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_009">Douglas, R.M. et al. “Vitamin C for Preventing and Treating the Common Cold.” <em class="emphasis">Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</em> 4 (2004): CD000980. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15495002?dopt=Abstract">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15495002?dopt=Abstract</a>.</span></p>

There is some evidence that taking vitamin C supplements at high doses increases the likelihood of developing kidney stones, however, this effect is most often observed in people that already have multiple risk factors for kidney stones.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s02_s05_p01">Citrus fruits are great sources of vitamin C and so are many vegetables. In fact, British sailors in the past were often referred to as “limeys” as they carried sacks of limes onto ships to prevent scurvy. Vitamin C is not found in significant amounts in animal-based foods.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s02_s05_p02">Because vitamin C is water soluble, it leaches away from foods considerably during cooking, freezing, thawing, and canning. Up to 50 percent of vitamin C can be boiled away. Therefore, to maximize vitamin C intake from foods, you should eat fruits and vegetables raw or lightly steamed.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Vitamin A Functions and Health Benefits</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_p01">Vitamin A is a generic term for a group of similar compounds called retinoids. Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived foods, and it is converted in the body to the biologically active forms of vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid (thus retinol is sometimes referred to as “preformed vitamin A”). About 10 percent of plant-derived carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can be converted in the body to retinoids and are another source of functional vitamin A. The retinoids are aptly named as their most notable function is in the retina of the eye where they aid in vision, particularly in seeing under low-light conditions. This is why night blindness is the most definitive sign of vitamin A deficiency.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_p02">Like vitamin E, vitamin A is fat-soluble and is packaged into chylomicrons in small intestine mucosal cells, and then transported to the liver. The liver stores and exports vitamin A as needed; it is released into the blood bound to a retinol-binding protein, which transports it to cells.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_p03">Vitamin A has several important functions in the body, including maintaining vision and a healthy immune system. Many of vitamin A’s functions in the body are similar to the functions of hormones (for example, vitamin A can interact with DNA, causing a change in protein function). Vitamin A assists in maintaining healthy skin and the linings and coverings of tissues; it also regulates growth and development. As an antioxidant, vitamin A protects cellular membranes, helps in maintaining glutathione levels, and influences the amount and activity of enzymes that detoxify free radicals.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Vision</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s01_p01">Retinol that is circulating in the blood is taken up by cells in the retina, where it is converted to retinal and is used as part of the pigment rhodopsin, which is involved in the eye’s ability to see under low light conditions. A deficiency in vitamin A thus results in less rhodopsin and a decrease in the detection of low-level light, a condition referred to as nightblindness.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s01_p02">Insufficient intake of dietary vitamin A over time can also cause complete vision loss. In fact, vitamin A deficiency is the number one cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Vitamin A not only supports the vision function of eyes but also maintains the coverings and linings of the eyes. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to the dysfunction of the linings and coverings of the eye, causing dryness of the eyes, a condition called xerophthalmia. This condition can progress, causing ulceration of the cornea and eventually blindness.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s02_p01">The common occurrence of advanced xerophthalmia in children who died from infectious diseases led scientists to hypothesize that supplementing vitamin A in the diet for children with xerophthalmia might reduce disease-related mortality. In Asia in the late 1980s, targeted populations of children were administered vitamin A supplements, and the death rates from measles and diarrhea declined by up to 50 percent. Vitamin A supplementation in these deficient populations did not reduce the number of children who contracted these diseases, but it did decrease the severity of the diseases so that they were no longer fatal. Soon after the results of these studies were communicated to the rest of the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commenced worldwide campaigns against vitamin A deficiency. UNICEF estimates that the distribution of over half a billion vitamin A capsules prevents 350,000 childhood deaths annually.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_010">Sommer, A. “Vitamin A Deficiency and Clinical Disease: An Historical Overview.” <em class="emphasis">J Nutr</em> 138 (2008):1835–39. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/138/10/1835.long">http://jn.nutrition.org/content/138/10/1835.long</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s02_p02">In the twenty-first century, science has demonstrated that vitamin A greatly affects the immune system. What we are still lacking are clinical trials investigating the proper doses of vitamin A required to help ward off infectious disease and how large of an effect vitamin A supplementation has on populations that are not deficient in this vitamin. This brings up one of our common themes in this text—micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to the development, progression, and severity of a disease, but this does not mean that an increased intake of these micronutrients will solely prevent or cure disease. The effect, as usual, is cumulative and depends on the diet as a whole, among other things.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s03_p01">Vitamin A acts similarly to some hormones in that it is able to change the amount of proteins in cells by interacting with DNA. This is the primary way that vitamin A affects growth and development. Vitamin A deficiency in children is linked to growth retardation; however, vitamin A deficiency is often accompanied by protein malnutrition and iron deficiency, thereby confounding the investigation of vitamin A’s specific effects on growth and development.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s03_p02">In the fetal stages of life, vitamin A is important for limb, heart, eye, and ear development and in both deficiency and excess, vitamin A causes birth defects.

It has been shown in some observational studies that vitamin A-deficient populations have a higher risk for some cancers. However, vitamin A supplements have actually been found to increase the risk of lung cancer in people who are at high risk for the disease (i.e., smokers, exsmokers, workers exposed to asbestos). The Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) involving over eighteen thousand participants who were at high risk for lung cancer found that people who took supplements containing very high doses of vitamin A (25,000 international units) and beta-carotene had a 28 percent higher incidence of lung cancer midway through the study, which was consequently stopped.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_011">Goodman, G.E. et al. “The Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial: Incidence of Lung Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality During 6-year Follow-up after Stopping Beta-Carotene and Retinol Supplements.” <em class="emphasis">J Natl Cancer Inst</em> 96, no. 23 (2004): 1743–50. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/96/23/1743.long">http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/96/23/1743.long</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s05_p01">Vitamin A toxicity, or hypervitaminosis A, is rare. Typically it requires you to ingest ten times the RDA of preformed vitamin A in the form of supplements (it would be hard to consume such high levels from a regular diet) for a substantial amount of time, although some people may be more susceptible to vitamin A toxicity at lower doses. The signs and symptoms of vitamin A toxicity include dry, itchy skin, loss of appetite, swelling of the brain, and joint pain. In severe cases, vitamin A toxicity may cause liver damage and coma.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s05_p02">Vitamin A is essential during pregnancy, but doses above 3,000 micrograms per day (10,000 international units) have been linked to an increased incidence of birth defects. Pregnant women should check the amount of vitamin A contained in any prenatal or pregnancy multivitamin she is taking to assure the amount is below the UL.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s06_p01">There is more than one source of vitamin A in the diet. There is preformed vitamin A, which is abundant in many animal-derived foods, and there are carotenoids, which are found in high concentrations in vibrantly colored fruits and vegetables and some oils.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s06_p02">Some carotenoids are converted to retinol in the body by intestinal cells and liver cells. However, only miniscule amounts of certain carotenoids are converted to retinol, meaning fruits and vegetables are not necessarily good sources of vitamin A. Beta-carotene dissolved in oil is more readily converted to retinol; one-half of a microgram of beta-carotene is converted to retinol. Overall, the carotenoids do not have the same biological potency of preformed vitamin A, but as you will soon find out, they have other attributes that influence health, most notably their antioxidant activity.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s06_p03">The RDA for vitamin A includes all sources of vitamin A. The amount of vitamin A obtained from carotenoids—the retinol activity equivalent (RAE)—can be calculated. For example, 12 micrograms of fruit- or vegetable-based beta-carotene will yield 1 microgram of retinol, as mentioned.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_s03_s06_p04">The RDA for vitamin A is considered sufficient to support growth and development, reproduction, vision, and immune system function while maintaining adequate stores (good for four months) in the liver.</p>

Carotenoids are one type of phytochemical. Phytochemicals also include indoles, lignans, phytoestrogens, stanols, saponins, terpenes, flavonoids, carotenoids, anthocyanidins, phenolic acids, and many more. They are found not only in fruits and vegetables, but also in grains, seeds, nuts, and legumes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p02">Many phytochemicals act as antioxidants, but they have several other functions, such as mimicking hormones, altering absorption of cholesterol, inhibiting inflammatory responses, and blocking the actions of certain enzymes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p03">Phytochemicals are present in small amounts in the food supply, and although thousands have been and are currently being scientifically studied, their health benefits remain largely unknown. Also largely unknown is their potential for toxicity, which could be substantial if taken in large amounts in the form of supplements. Moreover, phytochemicals often act in conjunction with each other and with micronutrients. Thus, supplementing with only a few may impair the functions of other phytochemicals or micronutrients. As with the antioxidant vitamins, it is the mixture and variety of phytochemicals in foods that are linked to health benefits.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p01">Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them their yellow, orange, and red color. Over six hundred carotenoids have been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found in the plant kingdom. There are two classes of carotenoids—the xanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do not.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p02">In plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and act as antioxidants. Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, gamma-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body. The other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not. Many biological actions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity, but they likely act by other mechanisms, too.</p>

Diets high in these carotenoids are associated with a decreased risk of AMD, and there is good evidence that supplements containing these carotenoids also provide vision benefits. A review published in the August 2010 issue of <em class="emphasis">Current Medical Research and Opinion</em> concludes that supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin reduces the incidence of AMD and cataracts.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_012">Barker II, F.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s01_s01_p02">The data that supports that beta-carotene supplementation may delay the progression of AMD is more convincing when beta-carotene is taken in combination with other micronutrients. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study found that a supplement containing 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 international units of vitamin E, 15 milligrams of beta-carotene, 80 milligrams of zinc oxide, and 2 milligrams of copper as cupric oxide reduced the risk of progressing to advanced stages of AMD by 25 percent.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_013">Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research Group. “A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Trial of High-Dose Supplementation with Vitamins C and E, Beta-Carotene, and Zinc for Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Vision Loss.” <em class="emphasis">Arch Ophthalmol</em> 119, no. 10 (2001): 1417–36. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1462955/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1462955/</a>.</span> This study did not find that the formulated supplement significantly prevented the onset of disease, only that it delayed its progression specifically in people with intermediate or advanced stage AMD. Studies are ongoing to determine if other antioxidant combinations actually protect against developing AMD at all.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s01_s02_p01">While some studies do associate a decreased risk for atherosclerosis with higher dietary intake of carotenoids, others do not. There is a large number of studies that show total carotenoid intake is associated with improvement in blood vessel function. A smaller number of studies show that intake of specific carotenoids, such as lycopene and alpha-carotene, are also associated with improved blood vessel function. The main problems associated with linking carotenoids to a decrease in cardiovascular disease risk, or any other disease for that matter, are that they are present in foods containing many other beneficial plant chemicals, and trials evaluating the effects of specific carotenoids in the form of supplements provide inconsistent and sometimes contradictory results.</p>

A review of two large studies (&gt; 120,000 men and women) published in the October 2000 issue of <em class="emphasis">The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> reports that there is no significant association between beta-carotene intake and lung cancer risk, but men and women with the highest intakes of total carotenoids had a more than 30 percent risk reduction for developing lung cancer.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_014">Michaud, D.S. et al. “Intake of Specific Carotenoids and Risk of Lung Cancer in 2 Prospective US Cohorts.” <em class="emphasis">Am J Clin Nutr</em> 72, no. 4 (2000): 990–97. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/72/4/990.long">http://www.ajcn.org/content/72/4/990.long</a>.</span> Other large studies conducted in Europe have confirmed the inverse relationship of total dietary carotenoid intake with lung cancer risk. There is some evidence that diets rich in lycopene, which is present in high concentrations in tomatoes, is linked to decreased prostate cancer risk, but it is not known if it is lycopene specifically or some other component in tomatoes that protects against prostate cancer.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s02_p01">Carotenoids are not absorbed as well as vitamin A, but similar to vitamin A, they do require fat in the meal for absorption. In intestinal cells, carotenoids are packaged into the lipid-containing chylomicrons inside small intestine mucosal cells and then transported to the liver. In the liver, carotenoids are repackaged into lipoproteins, which transport them to cells.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s02_p02">In contrast to most micronutrients, carotenoid availability is actually increased by the cooking process because cooking, along with chopping and homogenizing, releases carotenoids from the plant matrix. Thus, eating a can of tomatoes provides more lycopene than eating a raw tomato. However, overcooking transforms some of the carotenoids into inactive products, and in general it is best to chop and lightly steam vegetables containing carotenoids to maximize their availability from foods. Cooking carotenoid-containing foods in oil also enhances the bioavailability of carotenoids.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s02_p03">In the United States, the most consumed carotenoids are alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s03_p01">Three classes of phytochemicals (other than carotenoids) are flavonoids, organosulfur compounds, and lignans. Their potential health benefits are discussed below.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s03_s01_p01">Flavonoids are a large class of chemicals including anthocyanidins (found in red, blue, and purple berries), flavanols (found in teas, chocolate, berries, apples, yellow onions, kale, and broccoli), and isoflavones (found in soy products). Flavonoids are very effective free radical scavengers, and there is some evidence that higher intakes of flavonoid-rich foods and/or beverages reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, but this has not been consistently observed. Although flavonoids have been shown to reduce the incidence of some tumors in animals, similar studies in humans have been inconclusive.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s03_s02_p01">These compounds are predominantly found in garlic, but can also be found in onions and leeks. It’s suspected that the higher intake of garlic is the aspect of the Mediterranean diet that contributes to a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Animal and laboratory studies suggest the organosulfur compounds in garlic reduce cholesterol, are anti-inflammatory, stimulate the synthesis of glutathione, and cause death of cancer cells. There is some evidence in humans that garlic reduces cholesterol, but more recent studies did not confirm that the effect was signficant or sustained. A higher intake of garlic likely inhibits blood clot formation in humans.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s03_s02_p02">Observational studies suggest diets high in organosulfur compounds decrease the risk of gastric and colorectal cancer. For other cancers, the data is less consistent.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s03_s03_p01">Lignans are a group of chemical compounds obtained from many food sources, including grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables, and especially flax seed. Some lignans are also called phytoestrogens as they can mimic or inhibit some of the actions of the hormone estrogen in the body.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s03_s03_p02">The antiestrogenic effect of some lignans suggests they may be helpful in treating hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancers. However, studies are few and conflicting on whether eating foods high in lignans reduces breast or ovarian cancer.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s03_s03_p03">In regard to cardiovascular disease risk, diets rich in whole grains are protective, but it remains unclear whether it is the lignans in whole grains that are responsible for the reduced risk. Whole grains contain many other beneficial phytochemicals, micronutrients, and fiber.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s04_s02_p01">Tea is an aromatic beverage made from the dried parts of plants steeped in hot water. Its health benefits have been known for years, and as with coffee the benefits are not just physiological, but also mental and social. In folklore, teas are considered curatives of stomachache, diarrhea, and even the plague. In <em class="emphasis">The Book of Tea</em>, Okakura Kakuzo asserts that consuming a cup of tea provides “the adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence.”<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_015">Okakura Kakuzo. <em class="emphasis">The Book of Tea</em>.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_s04_s02_p02">Teas can contain more than seven hundred different phytochemicals. Some of them may be beneficial and others may not be, as some reduce the dietary absorption of some micronutrients. The health claims of drinking tea—black, green, or red—number at least in the hundreds but remain mostly scientifically unsupported. There are a great number of studies showing that drinking tea is at least linked to a decreased risk of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, but the exact phyotchemicals illiciting these health benefits are under intense scrutiny. Moreover, people who consume more tea are likely to drink fewer soft drinks and therefore, based on a “replacement theory,” have a reduced likelihood of having a chronic disease.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s01_p01">Around twenty-five known proteins require selenium to function. Some are enzymes involved in detoxifying free radicals and include glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase. As an integral functioning part of these enzymes, selenium aids in the regeneration of glutathione and oxidized vitamin C. Selenium as part of glutathione peroxidase also protects lipids from free radicals, and, in doing so, spares vitamin E. This is just one example of how antioxidants work together to protect the body against free radical-induced damage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s01_p02">Other functions of selenium-containing proteins include protecting endothelial cells that line tissues, converting the inactive thyroid hormone to the active form in cells, and mediating inflammatory and immune system responses.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s01_p03">Observational studies have demonstrated that selenium deficiency is linked to an increased risk of cancer. A review of forty-nine observational studies published in the May 2011 issue of the <em class="emphasis">Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</em> concludes that higher selenium exposure reduces overall cancer incidence by about 34 percent in men and 10 percent in women, but notes these studies had several limitations, including data quality, bias, and large differences among different studies.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_016">Dennert, G. et al. “Selenium for Preventing Cancer.” <em class="emphasis">Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</em> 5 (2011): CD005195. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21563143">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21563143</a>.</span> Additionally, this review states that there is no convincing evidence from six clinical trials that selenium supplements reduce cancer risk.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s01_p04">Because of its role as a lipid protector, selenium has been suspected to prevent cardiovascular disease.

See <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s01_s02_t01">Table 8.10 "Selenium Contents of Various Foods"</a> for the selenium content of various foods.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s02_p01">As with selenium, manganese, iron, copper, and zinc are essential cofactors for enzymes involved in detoxifying free radicals. In the proper doses they allow for optimal detoxification of free radicals. In excess and when not bound to proteins, manganese, iron, and copper actually accelerate the production of free radicals. This is an attribute of all antioxidants in general, although the effect is greater for certain antioxidants.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s02_p02">Antioxidants can become pro-oxidants when the conditions are altered. Recall from <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01#zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s01">Section 8.1 "Generation of Free Radicals in the Body"</a> of this chapter that oxidative stress results from an imbalance in free radicals with their detoxifying and repair systems. Another factor that can cause oxidative stress is a high level of antioxidants, as some will revert to acting as pro-oxidants.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_p01">A healthy diet incorporating seven or more servings of fruits and vegetables has been shown in many scientific studies to reduce cardiovascular disease and overall deaths attributable to cancer. The WHO states that insufficient fruit and vegetable intake is linked to approximately 14 percent of gastrointestinal cancer deaths, about 11 percent of heart attack deaths, and 9 percent of stroke deaths globally.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_017">World Health Organization. “Global Strategies on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health.” Accessed September 30, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/fruit/en/index.html">http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/fruit/en/index.html</a>.</span> The WHO estimates that, overall, 2.7 million deaths could be avoided annually by increasing fruit and vegetable intake. These preventable deaths place an economic, social, and mental burden on society. This is why, in 2003, the WHO and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations launched a campaign to promote fruit and vegetable intake worldwide.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_p02">In the last section we reviewed the health benefits of particular antioxidants and phytochemicals obtained from fruits and vegetables and discovered that naturally incorporating them in the diet rather than taking supplements is best. Here we will consider the scientific evidence that diets rich in antioxidants actually lower chronic disease risk.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Antioxidant Variety in Food Provides Health Benefits</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_p01">Not only has the several-billion-dollar supplement industry inundated us with FDA-unapproved health claims, but science is continously advancing and providing us with a multitude of promising health benefits from particular fruits, vegetables, teas, herbs, and spices. For instance, blueberries protect against cardiovascular disease, an apple or pear a day reduces stroke risk by over 52 percent, eating more carrots significantly reduces the risk of bladder cancer, drinking tea reduces cholesterol and helps glucose homeostasis, and cinnamon blocks infection and reduces the risk of some cancers. However, recall that science also tells us that no one nutrient alone is shown to provide these effects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_p02">What micronutrient and phytochemical sources are best at protecting against chronic disease? All of them, together. Just as there is no wonder supplement or drug, there is no superior fruit, vegetable, spice, herb, or tea that protects against all diseases. A review in the July–August 2010 issue of <em class="emphasis">Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</em> concludes that the plant-food benefits to health are attributed to two main factors—that nutrients and phytochemicals are present at low concentrations in general, and that the complex mixtures of nutrients and phytochemicals provides additive and synergistic effects.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_018">Bouayed, J. and T.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Mediterranean diet.</strong> Fresh fruit and vegetables are abundant in this diet, and the cultural identity of the diet involves multiple herbs and spices. Moreover, olive oil is the main source of fat. Fish and poultry are consumed in low amounts and red meat is consumed in very low amounts. An analysis of twelve studies involving over one million subjects published in the September 2008 issue of the <em class="emphasis">British Medical Journal</em> reports that people who followed the Mediterranean diet had a 9 percent decrease in overall deaths, a 9 percent decrease in cardiovascular death, a 6 percent decrease in cancer deaths, and a 13 percent reduced incidence of Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_019">Sofi, F. et al. “Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Health Status: Meta-Analysis.” <em class="emphasis">Br Med J</em> 337 (2008): a1344. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2533524/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2533524/</a>.</span> The authors of this study concluded that the Mediterranean diet is useful as a primary prevention against some major chronic diseases.</li>

Fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy foods, whole-grain foods, fish, poultry, and nuts are emphasized while red meats, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages are mostly avoided. Results from a follow-up study published in the December 2009 issue of the <em class="emphasis">Journal of Human Hypertension</em> suggest the low-sodium DASH diet reduces oxidative stress, which may have contributed to the improved blood vessel function observed in salt-sensitive people (between 10 to 20 percent of the population).<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_020">Al-Solaiman, Y. et al. “Low-Sodium DASH Reduces Oxidative Stress and Improves Vascular Function in Salt-Sensitive Humans.” <em class="emphasis">J Hum Hypertens</em> 12 (2009): 826–35. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2783838/?tool=pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2783838/?tool=pubmed</a>.</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p02">The USDA recommends that you fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. The number of servings of fruits and vegetables that a person should consume every day is dependent on age, sex, and level of physical activity. For example, a forty-year-old male who exercises for sixty minutes per day should consume 2 cups of fruit and 3½ cups of vegetables, while a fifteen-year-old female who exercises for thirty minutes per day should consume 1½ cups of fruit and 2½ cups of vegetables. (One cup of a fruit or vegetable is equal to one banana, one small apple, twelve baby carrots, one orange, or one large sweet potato.)
