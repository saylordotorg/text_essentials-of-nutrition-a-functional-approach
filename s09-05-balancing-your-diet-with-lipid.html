        <h2 class="title editable block">Identifying Sources of Fat</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_p01">Population-based studies of American diets have shown that intake of saturated fat is more excessive than intake of trans fat and cholesterol. Saturated fat is a prominent source of fat for most people as it is so easily found in animal fats, tropical oils such as coconut and palm oil, and full-fat dairy products. Oftentimes the fat in the diet of an average young person comes from foods such as cheese, pizza, cookies, chips, desserts, and animal meats such as chicken, burgers, sausages, and hot dogs. To aim for healthier dietary choices, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends choosing lean meats and vegetable alternatives, choosing dairy products with low fat content, and minimizing the intake of trans fats. The AHA guidelines also recommend consuming fish, especially oily fish, at least twice per week.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn05_012">American Heart Association. “Frequently Asked Questions About Fish.” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/General/Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Fish_UCM_306451_Article.jsp">http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/General/Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Fish _UCM_306451_Article.jsp</a>.</span> These more appropriate dietary choices will allow for enjoyment of a wide variety of foods while providing the body with the recommended levels of fat from healthier sources. Evaluate the following sources of fat in your overall dietary pattern:</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Monounsaturated fat.</strong> This type of fat is found in plant oils. Common sources are nuts (almonds, cashews, pecans, peanuts, and walnuts) and nut products, avocados, extra virgin olive oil, sesame oil, high oleic safflower oil, sunflower oil, and canola oil.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Polyunsaturated fat.</strong> This type of fat is found mainly in plant-based foods, oils, and fish. Common sources are nuts (walnuts, hazel nuts, pecans, almonds, and peanuts), soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil, flaxseed oil, canola oil, and fish (trout, herring, and salmon).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Saturated fat.</strong> This fat is found in animal products, dairy products, palm and coconut oils, and cocoa butter. Limit these products to less than 10 percent of your overall dietary fat consumption.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Trans fatty acids.</strong> Stick margarines, fast foods, commercial baked goods, and some snack foods contain trans fats. Limit your consumption of these products to keep trans fats to less than 1 percent of your fat consumption.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Omega-3 fatty acids (linolenic acid).</strong> Good sources of these are canola oil, flaxseed oil, soybean oil, olive oil, nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, and green leafy vegetables.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">DHA and EPA.</strong> Good sources of these are cod liver oil and fish such as tuna, herring, mackerel, salmon, and trout.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Omega-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid).</strong> Eggs, poultry, most vegetable oils, wheat germ oil, whole grains, baked goods, and cereals contain these fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids are present abundantly in nuts and seeds such as flaxseeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, and watermelon seeds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_p01">Recall that the body requires fatty acids and is adept at synthesizing the majority of these from fat, protein, and carbohydrate. However, when we say <em class="emphasis">essential</em> fatty acid we are referring to the two fatty acids that the body cannot create on its own, namely, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">linolenic acid</a><span class="glossdef">An omega-3 fatty acid that is essential for human health.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">linoleic acid</a><span class="glossdef">An omega-6 fatty acid that is essential for human health.</span></span>.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Omega-3 Fatty Acids.</strong> At the helm of the omega-3 fatty acid family is linolenic acid. From this fatty acid, the body can make <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)</a><span class="glossdef">An omega-3 fatty acid made from linolenic acid, found in fish.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)</a><span class="glossdef">An omega-3 fatty acid that is especially important for brain growth and development in infants.</span></span>. Linolenic acid is found in nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, and vegetable oil such as soybean, canola, and flaxseed. EPA and DHA are found abundantly in fatty fish.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Omega-6 Fatty Acids.</strong> At the helm of the omega-6 fatty acid family is linoleic acid. Like linolenic acid, the body uses linoleic acid to make other important substances such as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">arachidonic acid (ARA)</a><span class="glossdef">An omega-6 essential fatty acid that is a precursor to the synthesis of eicosanoids.</span></span> that is used to make eicosanoids. Recall that eicosanoids perform critical roles in the body as they affect a broad spectrum of functions. The word <em class="emphasis">eicosanoid</em> originates from the Greek word <em class="emphasis">eicosa</em>, meaning twenty, because this hormone is derived from ARA that is twenty carbon atoms in length. Eicosanoids affect the synthesis of all other body hormones and control all body systems, such as the central nervous system and the immune system. Among the many functions eicosanoids serve in the body, their primary function is to regulate inflammation. Without these hormones the body would not be able to heal wounds, fight infections, or fight off illness each time a foreign germ presented itself. Eicosanoids work together with the body’s immune and inflammation processes to play a major role in several important body functions, such as circulation, respiration, and muscle movement.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Attain the Omega-3 and Omega-6 Balance</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_s01_p01">As our food choices evolve, the sources of omega-6 fatty acids in our diets are increasing at a much faster rate than sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s are plentiful in diets of nonprocessed foods where grazing animals and foraging chickens roam free, eating grass, clover, alfalfa, and grass-dwelling insects. In contrast, today’s western diets are bombarded with sources of omega-6. For example, we have oils derived from seeds and nuts and from the meat of animals that are fed grain. Vegetable oils used in fast-food preparations, most snack-foods, cookies, crackers, and sweet treats are also loaded with omega-6 fatty acids. Also, our bodies synthesize eicosanoids from omega-6 fatty acids and these tend to increase inflammation, blood clotting, and cell proliferation, while the hormones synthesized from omega-3 fatty acids have just the opposite effect.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_s01_p02">While omega-6 fatty acids are essential, they can be harmful when they are out of balance with omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-6 fats are required only in small quantities. Researchers believe that when omega-6 fats are out of balance with omega-3 fats in the diet they diminish the effects of omega-3 fats and their benefits. This imbalance may elevate the risks for allergies, arthritis, asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and many types of cancer, autoimmunity, and neurodegenerative diseases, all of which are believed to originate from some form of inflammation in the body. The recommendations for the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids vary from 5:1 to 10:1.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_s01_p03">What does this mean for you? If your diet is low in omega-3 fats to begin with, then most of your essential fatty acids are from omega-6s. Stop. Do not set up a proinflammatory environment. Attaining proper balance between omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids means learning to make healthy choices and replacing bad fats with good ones that promote health and well-being.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch05_s05_s03_s01_l01">
                    <li>The recommended fat intake for adults is 20–35 percent of your total caloric intake. Saturated fat must be less than 10 percent of your total caloric intake, and lowering this to 7 percent can further reduce the risks for heart disease. Trans fat should be less than 1 percent of total caloric intake.</li>
                    <li>Nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, and vegetable oil such as soybean, canola, and flaxseed are excellent sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.</li>
                    <li>The polyunsaturated fatty acids linolenic and linoleic acids are used by the body to make substances that carry out many vital functions in the body.</li>
                    <li>The omega-3 fatty-acid family includes linolenic acid, EPA, and DHA. The omega-6 fatty-acid family includes linoleic acid and ARA. DHA and ARA play crucial roles in brain and eye development. EPA and DHA found in fatty fish play important roles in inflammation reduction and disease prevention.</li>
                    <li>Many people consume too many omega-6 fatty acids and not enough omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fats and omega-6 fats are precursors to hormones that have opposing properties. A proper balance between both must be obtained to avoid health problems.</li>
