    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_p01">A healthy diet incorporating seven or more servings of fruits and vegetables has been shown in many scientific studies to reduce cardiovascular disease and overall deaths attributable to cancer. The WHO states that insufficient fruit and vegetable intake is linked to approximately 14 percent of gastrointestinal cancer deaths, about 11 percent of heart attack deaths, and 9 percent of stroke deaths globally.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_017">World Health Organization. “Global Strategies on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health.” Accessed September 30, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/fruit/en/index.html">http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/fruit/en/index.html</a>.</span> The WHO estimates that, overall, 2.7 million deaths could be avoided annually by increasing fruit and vegetable intake. These preventable deaths place an economic, social, and mental burden on society. This is why, in 2003, the WHO and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations launched a campaign to promote fruit and vegetable intake worldwide.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_p02">In the last section we reviewed the health benefits of particular antioxidants and phytochemicals obtained from fruits and vegetables and discovered that naturally incorporating them in the diet rather than taking supplements is best. Here we will consider the scientific evidence that diets rich in antioxidants actually lower chronic disease risk.</p>
    <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Antioxidant Variety in Food Provides Health Benefits</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_p01">Not only has the several-billion-dollar supplement industry inundated us with FDA-unapproved health claims, but science is continously advancing and providing us with a multitude of promising health benefits from particular fruits, vegetables, teas, herbs, and spices. For instance, blueberries protect against cardiovascular disease, an apple or pear a day reduces stroke risk by over 52 percent, eating more carrots significantly reduces the risk of bladder cancer, drinking tea reduces cholesterol and helps glucose homeostasis, and cinnamon blocks infection and reduces the risk of some cancers. However, recall that science also tells us that no one nutrient alone is shown to provide these effects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_p02">What micronutrient and phytochemical sources are best at protecting against chronic disease? All of them, together. Just as there is no wonder supplement or drug, there is no superior fruit, vegetable, spice, herb, or tea that protects against all diseases. A review in the July–August 2010 issue of <em class="emphasis">Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</em> concludes that the plant-food benefits to health are attributed to two main factors—that nutrients and phytochemicals are present at low concentrations in general, and that the complex mixtures of nutrients and phytochemicals provides additive and synergistic effects.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_018">Bouayed, J. and T. Bohn. “Exogenous Antioxidants—Double-Edged Swords in Cellular Redox State: Health Beneficial Effects at Physiologic Doses versus Deleterious Effects at High Doses.” <em class="emphasis">Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</em> 3, no. 4 (2010): 228–37. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952083/?tool=pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952083/?tool=pubmed</a>.</span> In short, don’t overdo it with supplements and make sure you incorporate a wide variety of nutrients in your diet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_p03">Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants and phytochemicals promotes health. Consider these diets:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Mediterranean diet.</strong> Fresh fruit and vegetables are abundant in this diet, and the cultural identity of the diet involves multiple herbs and spices. Moreover, olive oil is the main source of fat. Fish and poultry are consumed in low amounts and red meat is consumed in very low amounts. An analysis of twelve studies involving over one million subjects published in the September 2008 issue of the <em class="emphasis">British Medical Journal</em> reports that people who followed the Mediterranean diet had a 9 percent decrease in overall deaths, a 9 percent decrease in cardiovascular death, a 6 percent decrease in cancer deaths, and a 13 percent reduced incidence of Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_019">Sofi, F. et al. “Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Health Status: Meta-Analysis.” <em class="emphasis">Br Med J</em> 337 (2008): a1344. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2533524/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2533524/</a>.</span> The authors of this study concluded that the Mediterranean diet is useful as a primary prevention against some major chronic diseases.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH diet).</strong> Recall from <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch07#zimmerman_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "Nutrients Important to Fluid and Electrolyte Balance"</a> that the DASH diet is an eating plan that is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat. Fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy foods, whole-grain foods, fish, poultry, and nuts are emphasized while red meats, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages are mostly avoided. Results from a follow-up study published in the December 2009 issue of the <em class="emphasis">Journal of Human Hypertension</em> suggest the low-sodium DASH diet reduces oxidative stress, which may have contributed to the improved blood vessel function observed in salt-sensitive people (between 10 to 20 percent of the population).<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_020">Al-Solaiman, Y. et al. “Low-Sodium DASH Reduces Oxidative Stress and Improves Vascular Function in Salt-Sensitive Humans.” <em class="emphasis">J Hum Hypertens</em> 12 (2009): 826–35. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2783838/?tool=pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2783838/?tool=pubmed</a>.</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p01">An article in the January 2009 issue of the <em class="emphasis">Medscape Journal of Medicine</em> reports that fewer than one in ten Americans consumes the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables, which is between five and thirteen servings per day.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn08_022">Kimmons, J. et al. “Fruit and Vegetable Intake among Adolescents and Adults in the United States: Percentage Meeting Individualized Recommendations.” <em class="emphasis">Medscape Journal of Medicine</em> 11, no. 1 (2009): 26. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2654704/?tool=pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2654704/?tool=pubmed</a>.</span> According to this study, the largest single contributor to fruit intake was orange juice, and potatoes were the dominant vegetable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p02">The USDA recommends that you fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. The number of servings of fruits and vegetables that a person should consume every day is dependent on age, sex, and level of physical activity. For example, a forty-year-old male who exercises for sixty minutes per day should consume 2 cups of fruit and 3½ cups of vegetables, while a fifteen-year-old female who exercises for thirty minutes per day should consume 1½ cups of fruit and 2½ cups of vegetables. (One cup of a fruit or vegetable is equal to one banana, one small apple, twelve baby carrots, one orange, or one large sweet potato.)
