    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s05_p01">Physiologically, hunger relates to appetite and is the body’s response to a need for nourishment. Through stomach discomfort or intestinal rumbling, the body alerts the brain that it requires food. This uneasy sensation is easily addressed with a snack or a full meal. However, the term “hunger” also relates to a weakened condition that is a consequence of a prolonged lack of food. People who suffer from this form of hunger typically experience malnourishment, along with poor growth and development.</p>

However, millions of people in North America, not to mention globally, go hungry and are malnourished each year due to a recurring and involuntary lack of food. The economic crisis of 2008 caused a dramatic increase in hunger across the United States.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_042">World Hunger.org. “Hunger in America: 2011 United States Hunger and Poverty Facts.” Accessed October 10, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/Learn/us_hunger_facts.htm">http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/Learn/us_hunger_facts.htm</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s05_s01_s02_s01_p01">Most American households are considered to be food secure, which means they have adequate access to food and consume enough nutrients to achieve a healthy lifestyle. However, a minority of US households experiences food insecurity at certain points during the year, which means their access to food is limited due to a lack of money or other resources. This graphic shows the percentage of food-secure and food-insecure households in the United States during the year 2010.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s05_s01_s02_s02_p01">Food insecurity is defined as not having adequate access to food that meets nutritional needs. According to the USDA, about 48.8 million people live in food-insecure households and have reported multiple indications of food access problems. About sixteen million of those have “very low food security,” which means one or more people in the household were hungry at some point over the course of a year due to the inability to afford enough food. The difference between low and very low food security is that members of low insecurity households have reported problems of food access, but have reported only a few instances of reduced food intake, if any.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_043">Coleman-Jensen, A. et al. “Household Food Security in the United States in 2010.” US Department of Agriculture, <em class="emphasis">Economic Research Report</em>, no.

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s05_s01_s02_s02_p02">Households with limited resources employ a variety of methods to increase their access to adequate food. Some families purchase junk food and fast food—cheaper options that are also very unhealthy. Other families who struggle with food security supplement the groceries they purchase by participating in government assistance programs. They may also obtain food from emergency providers, such as food banks and soup kitchens in their communities.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s05_s01_s02_s03_p01">A person living in a food-insecure household may suffer from malnutrition, which results from a failure to meet nutrient requirements. This can occur as a result of consuming too little food or not enough key nutrients. There are two basic types of malnutrition. The first is macronutrient deficiency and relates to the lack of adequate protein, which is required for cell growth, maintenance, and repair. The second type of malnutrition is micronutrient deficiency and relates to inadequate vitamin and mineral intake.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_045">World Hunger. “2011 World Hunger and Poverty Facts and Statistics.” Accessed October 10, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/Learn/world%20hunger%20facts%202002.htm">http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/Learn/world%20hunger%20facts%202002.htm</a>.</span> Even people who are overweight or obese can suffer from this kind of malnutrition if they eat foods that do not meet all of their nutritional needs.</p>

They include low-income families and the working poor, who are employed but have incomes below the federal poverty level.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s05_s01_s03_p02">Senior citizens are also a major at-risk group. Many elderly people are frail and isolated, which affects their ability to meet their dietary requirements. In addition, many also have low incomes, limited resources, and difficulty purchasing or preparing food due to health issues or poor mobility. As a result, more than six million senior citizens in the United States face the threat of hunger.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn14_047">Meals on Wheels. “Our Vision and Mission.” Accessed October 10, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mowaa.org/page.aspx?pid=299">http://www.mowaa.org/page.aspx?pid=299</a></span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch14_s05_s02_p01">The federal government has established a number of programs that work to alleviate hunger and ensure that many low-income families receive the nutrition they require to live a healthy life. A number of programs were strengthened by the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.

This monetary figure is the minimum amount that a family would need to acquire shelter, food, clothing, and other necessities. It is calculated based on family size and is adjusted for annual inflation. Although many people who fall below the FPL are unemployed, the working poor can qualify for food programs and other forms of public assistance if their income is less than a certain percentage of the federal poverty level, along with other qualifications.</p>
