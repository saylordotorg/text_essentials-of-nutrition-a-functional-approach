        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s01_p02">In the United States, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act passed in 1990 and came into effect in 1994. In Canada, mandatory labeling came into effect in 2005. As a result, all packaged foods sold in the United States and Canada must have nutrition labels that accurately reflect the contents of the food products. There are several mandated nutrients and some optional ones that manufacturers or packagers include. <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s01_t01">Table 2.8 "Mandatory and Optional Inclusions on Nutrition Labels"</a> lists the mandatory and optional inclusions.</p>

Because the serving sizes are included on the label, you can see how much of each nutrient is in each serving to make the comparisons. Knowing how to read the label is important because of the way some foods are presented. For example, a bag of peanuts at the grocery store may seem like a healthy snack to eat on the way to class. But have a look at that label. Does it contain one serving, or multiple servings? Unless you are buying the individual serving packages, chances are the bag you picked up is at least eight servings, if not more.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s01_p05">According to the 2010 health and diet survey released by the FDA, 54 percent of first-time buyers of a product will check the food label and will use this information to evaluate fat, calorie, vitamin, and sodium content.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_018">US Food and Drug Administration. “Survey Shows Gain in Food-Label Use, Health/Diet Awareness.” March 2, 2010. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm202611.htm#FoodLabelHighlights">http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm202611.htm#FoodLabelHighlights</a>.</span> The survey also notes that more Americans are using food labels and are showing an increased awareness of the connection between diet and health. Having reliable food labels is a top priority of the FDA, which has a new initiative to prepare guidelines for the food industry to construct “front of package” labeling that will make it even easier for Americans to choose healthy foods.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reading the Label</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_p01">The first part of the Nutrition Facts panel gives you information on the serving size and how many servings are in the container. For example, a label on a box of crackers might tell you that twenty crackers equals one serving and that the whole box contains 10 servings. All other values listed thereafter, from the calories to the dietary fiber, are based on this one serving. On the panel, the serving size is followed by the number of calories and then a list of selected nutrients. You will also see “Percent Daily Value” on the far right-hand side. This helps you determine if the food is a good source of a particular nutrient or not. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Daily Value (DV)</a><span class="glossdef">Based upon the RDI of a specific nutrient in a 2,000 kilocalorie diet.</span></span> represents the recommended amount of a given nutrient based on the RDI of that nutrient in a 2,000-kilocalorie diet (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_f03">Figure 2.2 "Determining Your Nutrient Allowances per Day"</a>). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">percentage of Daily Value (percent DV)</a><span class="glossdef">The percentage of the amount of the nutrient in relationship to the DV. They are applicable only for a 2,000-calorie daily diet (not 2,500 calories).</span></span> represents the proportion of the total daily recommended amount that you will get from one serving of the food. For example, in the food label in <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_f03">Figure 2.2 "Determining Your Nutrient Allowances per Day"</a>, the percent DV of calcium for one serving of macaroni-and-cheese is 20 percent, which means that one serving of macaroni and cheese provides 20 percent of the daily recommended calcium intake. Since the DV for calcium is 1,000 milligrams, the food producer determined the <em class="emphasis">percent</em> DV for calcium by taking the calcium content in milligrams in each serving, and dividing it by 1,000 milligrams, and then multiplying it by 100 to get it into percentage format. Whether you consume 2,000 calories per day or not you can still use the percent DV as a target reference.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_p02">Generally, a percent DV of 5 is considered low and a percent DV of 20 is considered high. This means, as a general rule, for fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium, look for foods with a low percent DV. Alternatively, when concentrating on essential mineral or vitamin intake, look for a high percent DV. To figure out your fat allowance remaining for the day after consuming one serving of macaroni-and-cheese, look at the percent DV for fat, which is 18 percent, and subtract it from 100 percent. To know this amount in grams of fat, read the footnote of the food label to find that the recommended maximum amount of fat grams to consume per day for a 2,000 kilocalories per day diet is 65 grams. Eighteen percent of sixty-five equals about 12 grams. This means that 53 grams of fat are remaining in your fat allowance. Remember, to have a healthy diet the recommendation is to eat less than this amount of fat grams per day, especially if you want to lose weight.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_s02_p01">Often we hear news of a particular nutrient or food product that contributes to our health or may prevent disease. A health claim is a statement that links a particular food with a reduced risk of developing disease. As such, health claims such as “reduces heart disease,” must be evaluated by the FDA before it may appear on packaging. Prior to the passage of the NLEA products that made such claims were categorized as drugs and not food. All health claims must be substantiated by scientific evidence in order for it to be approved and put on a food label. To avoid having companies making false claims, laws also regulate how health claims are presented on food packaging. In addition to the claim being backed up by scientific evidence, it may never claim to cure or treat the disease.

The evidence may suggest that the food or nutrient is beneficial.

One serving of [name of food] provides [X] grams of EPA and DHA omega-3  fatty acids.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s07_s02_s05_p01">Food manufacturers are required by the FDA to list on their packages if the product contains any of the eight most common ingredients that cause food allergies. These eight common allergens are as follows: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat. (More information on these allergens will be discussed in <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch11#zimmerman_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Energy Balance and Body Weight"</a>.) The FDA does not require warnings that cross contamination may occur during packaging, however most manufacturers include this advisory as a courtesy. For instance, you may notice a label that states, “This product is manufactured in a factory that also processes peanuts.” If you have food allergies, it is best to avoid products that may have been contaminated with the allergen.</p>

                    <li>The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act made it a law that foods sold in the United States have a food label that provides the accurate contents of nutrients within them. Canada has a similar law.</li>
                    <li>A Nutrition Facts panel gives information on the amount of servings per container, the amount of calories per serving, and the amounts of certain nutrients.</li>
                    <li>The percent DV is the percentage of the amount of the nutrient in the food in relationship to its recommended intake. It is a guide to help you determine if a food is a good or poor source of nutrients.</li>
                    <li>To keep companies from making false claims, the FDA provides regulation for food manufacturers in putting labels on packages that promote health. Allergens must also be listed on food labels. Sometimes cross contamination does occur during packaging. Most food manufacturers voluntarily list this information. If you have a food allergy, it is best to avoid any product that has even had the possibility of coming in contact with a known allergen.</li>
