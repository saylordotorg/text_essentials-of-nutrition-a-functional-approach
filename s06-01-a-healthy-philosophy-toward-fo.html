    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s01_p01">“Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are” wrote the French lawyer and politician, Antheime Brillat-Savarin in his book, <em class="emphasis">Physiologie du Gout, ou Meditations de Gastronomie Transcendante</em>, in 1826. Almost one hundred years later, nutritionist Victor Lindlahr wrote in an ad in 1923, “Ninety percent of the diseases known to man are caused by cheap foodstuffs. You are what you eat.” Today, we know this phrase simply as, “You are what you eat.”<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_001">Phrase Finder. Accessed July 6, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/you%20are%20what%20you%20eat.html">http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/you%20are%20what%20you%20eat.html</a></span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s01_p02">Good nutrition equates to receiving enough (but not too much) of the macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and water) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) so that the body can stay healthy, grow properly, and work effectively. The phrase “you are what you eat” refers to the fact that your body will respond to the food it receives, either good or bad. Processed, sugary, high-fat, and excessively salted foods leave the body tired and unable to perform effectively. By contrast, eating fresh, natural whole foods fuels the body by providing what it needs to produce energy, promote metabolic activity, prevent micronutrient deficiencies, ward off chronic disease, and to promote a sense of overall health and well-being.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p01">For many, the word “malnutrition” produces an image of a child in a third-world country with a bloated belly, and skinny arms and legs. However, this image alone is not an accurate representation of the state of malnutrition. For example, someone who is 150 pounds overweight can also be malnourished. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Malnutrition</a><span class="glossdef">A condition where one does not receive proper amounts of nutrients. This condition may have resulted from an inadequate or unbalanced diet, digestive and absorption problems, or other medical issues.</span></span> refers to one not receiving <em class="emphasis">proper</em> nutrition and does not distinguish between the consequences of <em class="emphasis">too many</em> nutrients or the <em class="emphasis">lack</em> of nutrients, both of which impair overall health. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Undernutrition</a><span class="glossdef">A condition where a person is not consuming enough nutrients, which leads to malnutrition.</span></span> is characterized by a lack of nutrients and insufficient energy supply, whereas <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">overnutrition</a><span class="glossdef">A condition where a person is consuming too much food and too many nutrients, which may lead to malnutrition.</span></span> is characterized by excessive nutrient and energy intake. Overnutrition can result in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">obesity</a><span class="glossdef">A metabolic disorder that leads to the overaccumulation of fat tissue, compromising overall health.</span></span>, a growing global health threat. Obesity is defined as a metabolic disorder that leads to an overaccumulation of fat tissue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p02">Although not as prevalent in America as it is in developing countries, undernutrition is not uncommon and affects many subpopulations, including the elderly, those with certain diseases, and those in poverty. Many people who live with diseases either have no appetite or may not be able to digest food properly. Some medical causes of malnutrition include cancer, inflammatory bowel syndrome, AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, illnesses or conditions that cause chronic pain, psychiatric illnesses, such as anorexia nervosa, or as a result of side effects from medications. Overnutrition is an epidemic in the United States and is known to be a risk factor for many diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis), and cancer.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Growth and Development</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch02_s01_s02_p01">From birth to adulthood, nutrients fuel proper growth and function of all body cells, tissue, and systems. Without proper amounts of nutrients, growth and development are stunted. Some nutrient deficiencies manifest right away, but sometimes the effects of undernutrition aren’t seen until later in life. For example, if children do not consume proper amounts of calcium and vitamin D, peak bone mass will be reduced compared to what it would be had adequate amounts of these nutrients been consumed. When adults enter old age without adequate bone mass, they are more susceptible to osteoporosis, putting them at risk for bone fractures. Therefore, it is vital to build bone strength through proper nutrition during youth because it cannot be done in later life.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn02_002">MedicineNet.com. “Nutrients for the Growing Years.” Last reviewed August 13, 2003. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10054">http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10054</a>.</span></p>
