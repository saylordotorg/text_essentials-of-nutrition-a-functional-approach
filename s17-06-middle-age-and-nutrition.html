    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_p01">During this stage of the human life cycle, adults begin to experience the first outward signs of aging. Wrinkles begin to appear, joints ache after a highly active day, and body fat accumulates. There is also a loss of muscle tone and elasticity in the connective tissue.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_032">Elaine U. Polan, RNC, MS and Daphne R. Taylor, RN, MS, <em class="emphasis">Journey Across the Life Span: Human Development and Health Promotion</em> (Philadelphia: F. A.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Middle Age (Ages Thirty-One to Fifty): Aging Well</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_p01">Many people in their late thirties and in their forties notice a decline in endurance, the onset of wear-and-tear injuries (such as osteoarthritis), and changes in the digestive system. Wounds and other injuries also take longer to heal. Body composition changes due to fat deposits in the trunk. To maintain health and wellness during the middle-aged years and beyond, it is important to:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_l01">
            <li>maintain a healthy body weight</li>
            <li>consume nutrient-dense foods</li>
            <li>drink alcohol moderately or not at all</li>
            <li>be a nonsmoker</li>
            <li>engage in moderate physical activity at least 150 minutes per week</li>

        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Energy</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_s01_p01">The energy requirements for ages thirty-one to fifty are 1,800 to 2,200 calories for women and 2,200 to 3,000 calories for men, depending on activity level. These estimates do not include women who are pregnant or breastfeeding (see <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch12#zimmerman_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Nutrition through the Life Cycle: From Pregnancy to the Toddler Years"</a>). Middle-aged adults must rely on healthy food sources to meet these needs. In many parts of North America, typical dietary patterns do not match the recommended guidelines. For example, five foods—iceberg lettuce, frozen potatoes, fresh potatoes, potato chips, and canned tomatoes—account for over half of all vegetable intake.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_033">Adam Drewnowski and Nicole Darmon. “Food Choices and Diet Cost: an Economic Analysis.” <em class="emphasis">The Journal of Nutrition</em>. © 2005 The American Society for Nutritional Sciences.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Macronutrients and Micronutrients</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_s02_p01">The AMDRs for carbohydrates, protein, fat, fiber, and fluids remain the same from young adulthood into middle age (see <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05#zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s05">Section 13.5 "Young Adulthood and Nutrition"</a> of this chapter). It is important to avoid putting on excess pounds and limiting an intake of SoFAAS to help avoid cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic conditions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_s02_p02">There are some differences, however, regarding micronutrients. For men, the recommendation for magnesium increases to 420 milligrams daily, while middle-aged women should increase their intake of magnesium to 320 milligrams per day. Other key vitamins needed during the middle-aged years include folate and vitamins B<sub class="subscript">6</sub> and B<sub class="subscript">12</sub> to prevent elevation of homocysteine, a byproduct of metabolism that can damage arterial walls and lead to atherosclerosis, a cardiovascular condition. Again, it is important to meet nutrient needs with food first, then supplementation, such as a daily multivitamin, if you can’t meet your needs through food.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Preventive/Defensive Nutrition</h2>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_s03_p01">During the middle-aged years, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">preventive nutrition</a><span class="glossdef">The use of dietary practices to reduce disease and promote health and well-being.</span></span> can promote wellness and help organ systems to function optimally throughout aging. Preventive nutrition is defined as dietary practices directed toward reducing disease and promoting health and well-being. Healthy eating in general—such as eating unrefined carbohydrates instead of refined carbohydrates and avoiding trans fats and saturated fats—helps to promote wellness. However, there are also some things that people can do to target specific concerns. One example is consuming foods high in antioxidants, such as strawberries, blueberries, and other colorful fruits and vegetables, to reduce the risk of cancer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_s03_p02">Phytochemicals are compounds in fruits and vegetables that act as defense systems for plants. Different phytochemicals are beneficial in different ways. For example, carotenoids, which are found in carrots, cantaloupes, sweet potatoes, and butternut squash, may protect against cardiovascular disease by helping to prevent the oxidation of cholesterol in the arteries, although research is ongoing.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_034">Sari Voutilainen, Tarja Nurmi, Jaakko Mursu, and Tiina H.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_s03_p03">Omega-3 fatty acids can help to prevent coronary artery disease. These crucial nutrients are found in oily fish, including salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, cod, and halibut. Other beneficial fats that are vital for healthy functioning include monounsaturated fats, which are found in plant oils, avocados, peanuts, and pecans.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Menopause</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch13_s06_s02_p01">In the middle-aged years, women undergo a specific change that has a major effect on their health. They begin the process of menopause, typically in their late forties or early fifties. The ovaries slowly cease to produce estrogen and progesterone, which results in the end of menstruation. Menopausal symptoms can vary, but often include hot flashes, night sweats, and mood changes. The hormonal changes that occur during menopause can lead to a number of physiological changes as well, including alterations in body composition, such as weight gain in the abdominal area. Bone loss is another common condition related to menopause due to the loss of female reproductive hormones. Bone thinning increases the risk of fractures, which can affect mobility and the ability to complete everyday tasks, such as cooking, bathing, and dressing.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn13_036">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Eating Right During Menopause.” © 1995–2012.
