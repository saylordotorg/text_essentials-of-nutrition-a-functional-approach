    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s00_p02">Maintaining the right level of water in your body is crucial to survival, as either too little or too much water in your body will result in less-than-optimal functioning. One mechanism to help ensure the body maintains water balance is thirst. Thirst is the result of your body’s physiology telling your brain to initiate the thought to take a drink. Sensory proteins detect when your mouth is dry, your blood volume too low, or blood electrolyte concentrations too high and send signals to the brain stimulating the conscious feeling to drink.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s00_p03">In the summer of 1965, the assistant football coach of the University of Florida Gators requested scientists affiliated with the university study why the withering heat of Florida caused so many heat-related illnesses in football players and provide a solution to increase athletic performance and recovery post-training or game. The discovery was that inadequate replenishment of fluids, carbohydrates, and electrolytes was the reason for the “wilting” of their football players. Based on their research, the scientists concocted a drink for the football players containing water, carbohydrates, and electrolytes and called it “Gatorade.” In the next football season the Gators were nine and two and won the Orange Bowl. The Gators’ success launched the sports-drink industry, which is now a multibillion-dollar industry that is still dominated by Gatorade.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s00_p04">The latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, covering the period from 2005 to 2008, reports that about 50 percent of Americans consume sugary drinks daily.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_001">Ogden, C. et al. “Consumption of Sugar Drinks in the United States, 2005–2008.” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <em class="emphasis">NCHS Data Brief</em>, no. 71 (August 2011). <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db71.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db71.htm</a>.</span> Excess consumption of sugary soft drinks have been scientifically proven to increase the risk for dental caries, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In addition to sugary soft drinks, beverages containing added sugars include fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks and sweetened bottled waters. In <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch04#zimmerman_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Carbohydrates"</a> we considered in detail the effects of sugary soft drinks on health. In this chapter we will consider sports drinks. Sports drinks are designed to rehydrate the body after excessive fluid depletion. Electrolytes in particular promote normal rehydration to prevent fatigue during physical exertion. Are they a good choice for achieving the recommended fluid intake? Are they performance and endurance enhancers like they claim? Who should drink them?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s00_p05">Typically, eight ounces of a sports drink provides between fifty and eighty calories and 14 to 17 grams of carbohydrate, mostly in the form of simple sugars. Sodium and potassium are the most commonly included electrolytes in sports drinks, with the levels of these in sports drinks being highly variable. The American College of Sports Medicine says a sports drink should contain 125 milligrams of sodium per 8 ounces as it is helpful in replenishing some of the sodium lost in sweat and promotes fluid uptake in the small intestine, improving hydration.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s01_p01">A human body is made up of mostly water. An adult consists of about 37 to 42 liters of water, or about eighty pounds. Fortunately, humans have compartmentalized tissues; otherwise we might just look like a water balloon! Newborns are approximately 70 percent water. Adult males typically are composed of about 60 percent water and females are about 55 percent water. (This gender difference reflects the differences in body-fat content, since body fat is practically water-free. This also means that if a person gains weight in the form of fat the percentage of total body water content declines.) As we age total body water content also diminishes so that by the time we are in our eighties the percent of water in our bodies has decreased to around 45 percent. Does the loss in body water play a role in the aging process? Alas, no one knows. But, we do know that dehydration accelerates the aging process whereas keeping hydrated decreases headaches, muscle aches, and kidney stones. Additionally a study conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle found that women who drank more than five glasses of water each day had a significantly decreased risk for developing colon cancer.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_002">Shannon J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p01">Although water makes up the largest percentage of body volume, it is not actually pure water but rather a mixture of cells, proteins, glucose, lipoproteins, electrolytes, and other substances. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Electrolytes</a><span class="glossdef">Substances that when dissolved in water disassociate into charged ions.</span></span> are substances that, when dissolved in water, disassociate into charged ions. Positively charged electrolytes are called <strong class="emphasis bold">cations</strong> and negatively charged electrolytes are called <strong class="emphasis bold">anions</strong>. For example, in water sodium chloride (the chemical name for table salt) dissasociates into sodium cations (Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup>) and chloride anions (Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup>). <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Solutes</a><span class="glossdef">Any dissolved substances in a fluid.</span></span> refers to all dissolved substances in a fluid, which may be charged, such as sodium (Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup>), or uncharged, such as glucose. In the human body, water and solutes are distributed into two compartments: inside cells, called <strong class="emphasis bold">intracellular</strong>, and outside cells, called <strong class="emphasis bold">extracellular</strong>. The extracellular water compartment is subdivided into the spaces between cells (interstitial), blood plasma, and other bodily fluids (such as cerebrospinal fluid which surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord). The composition of solutes differs between the fluid compartments. For instance, more protein is inside cells than outside and more chloride anions exist outside of cells than inside.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Osmoregulation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p01">One of the essential homeostatic functions of the body is to maintain fluid balance and the differences in solute composition between cells and their surrounding environment. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Osmoregulation</a><span class="glossdef">The scientific term that refers to the control of fluid balance and composition in the body.</span></span> is the control of fluid balance and composition in the body. The processes involved keep fluids from becoming too dilute or too concentrated. Fluid compartments are separated by selectively permeable membranes, which allow some things, such as water, to move through while other substances require special transport proteins, channels, and often energy. The movement of water between fluid compartments happens by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">osmosis</a><span class="glossdef">The movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane from an area where it is highly concentrated to an area where it is not as concentrated.</span></span>, which is simply the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane from an area where it is highly concentrated to an area where it is not so concentrated. Water is never transported actively; that is, it never takes energy for water to move between compartments (see <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_s01_n01">Note 7.10 "Video 7.3"</a>). Although cells do not directly control water movement, they do control movement of electrolytes and other solutes and thus indirectly regulate water movement by controlling where there will be regions of high and low concentrations.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p02">Cells maintain their water volume at a constant level, but the composition of solutes in a cell is in a continuous state of flux. This is because cells are bringing nutrients in, metabolizing them, and disposing of waste products. To maintain water balance a cell controls the movement of electrolytes to keep the total number of dissolved particles, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">osmolality</a><span class="glossdef">The total number of dissolved particles in a solvent, such as water.</span></span> the same inside and outside (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 7.1</a>). The total number of dissolved substances is the same inside and outside a cell, but the composition of the fluids differs between compartments. For example, sodium exists in extracellular fluid at fourteen times the concentration as compared to that inside a cell.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p03">If a cell is placed in a solution that contains fewer dissolved particles (known as a hypotonic solution) than the cell itself, water moves into the more concentrated cell, causing it to swell (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 7.1</a>). Alternatively, if a cell is placed in a solution that is more concentrated (known as a hypertonic solution) water moves from inside the cell to the outside, causing it to shrink. Cells keep their water volume constant by pumping electrolytes in and out in an effort to balance the concentrations of dissolved particles on either side of their membranes. When a solution contains an equal concentration of dissolved particles on either side of the membrane, it is known as an isotonic solution.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s02_p01">You get up in the morning, flush wastes down the toilet, take a shower, brush your teeth, drink, eat, drive, wash the grime from your windshield, get to work, and drink coffee. Next to a fountain you eat lunch and down it with a glass of water, you use the toilet again and again, drive home, prepare dinner, etc. Add all the ways you use water every day and you still will not come close to the countless uses water has in the human body. Of all the nutrients, water is the most critical as its absence proves lethal within a few days. Organisms have adapted numerous mechanisms for water conservation. Water uses in the human body can be loosely categorized into four basic functions: transportation vehicle, medium for chemical reactions, lubricant/shock absorber, and temperature regulator.</p>

    <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Water As a Transportation Vehicle</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_p01">Water is called the “universal solvent” because more substances dissolve in it than any other fluid. Molecules dissolve in water because of the hydrogen and oxygen molecules ability to loosely bond with other molecules. Molecules of water (H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O) surround substances, suspending them in a sea of water molecules. The solvent action of water allows for substances to be more readily transported. A pile of undissolved salt would be difficult to move throughout tissues, as would a bubble of gas or a glob of fat. Blood, the primary transport fluid in the body is about 78 percent water. Dissolved substances in blood include proteins, lipoproteins, glucose, electrolytes, and metabolic waste products, such as carbon dioxide and urea, all of which are either dissolved in the watery surrounding of blood to be transported to cells to support basic functions or are removed from cells to prevent waste build-up and toxicity. Blood is not just the primary vehicle of transport in the body, but also as a fluid tissue blood structurally supports blood vessels that would collapse in its absence. Similarly, the brain is 75 percent water, with the water in the brain providing structure.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Water As a Medium for Chemical Reactions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s02_s02_p01">Water is required for even the most basic chemical reactions. In <a class="xref" href="zimmerman_1.0-ch06#zimmerman_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "Proteins"</a> you learned that enzymes are proteins and proteins fold into their functional shape based on how their amino-acid sequences react with water. Once formed, enzymes must conduct their specific chemical reactions in a medium, which in all organisms is water. Water is an ideal medium for chemical reactions as it can store a large amount of heat, is electrically neutral, and has a pH of 7.0, meaning it is not acidic or basic. Additionally, water is involved in many enzymatic reactions as an agent to break bonds or, by its removal from a molecule, to form bonds.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_p01">Many may view the slimy products of a sneeze as gross, but sneezing is essential for removing irritants and could not take place without water. Mucus, which is not only essential to discharge nasal irritants, but also required for breathing, transportation of nutrients along the gastrointestinal tract, and elimination of waste materials through the rectum is composed of more than 90 percent water. Mucus is a front-line defense against injury and foreign invaders. It protects tissues from irritants, entraps pathogens, and contains immune-system cells that destroy pathogens. Water is the main component of the lubricating fluid between joints and eases the movement of articulated bones.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_p02">The aqueous and vitreous humors, which are fluids that fill the extra space in the eyes and the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord are primarily water and buffer these organs against sudden changes in the environment. Watery fluids surrounding organs provide both chemical and mechanical protection. Just two weeks after fertilization water fills the amniotic sac in a pregnant woman providing a cushion of protection for the developing embryo.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Water As a Temperature Regulator</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s02_s04_p01">Another homeostatic function of the body, termed <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thermoregulation</a><span class="glossdef">The balance of heat gain with heat loss in the body.</span></span> is to balance heat gain with heat loss and body water plays an important role in accomplishing this. Human life is supported within a narrow range of temperature, with the temperature set point of the body being 98.6°F (37°C). Too low or too high of a temperature causes enzymes to stop functioning and metabolism is haulted. At 82.4°F (28°C) muscle failure occurs and hypothermia sets in. At the opposite extreme of 111.2°F (44°C) the central nervous system fails and death results. Water is good at storing heat, an attribute referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">heat capacity</a><span class="glossdef">The capability of a substance to store heat.</span></span> and thus helps maintain the temperature set point of the body despite changes in the surrounding environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s02_s04_p02">There are several mechanisms in place that move body water from place to place as a method to distribute heat in the body and equalize body temperature (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s02_s04_f01">Figure 7.2</a>). The hypothalamus in the brain is the thermoregulatory center. The hypothalamus contains special protein sensors that detect blood temperature. The skin also contains temperature sensors that respond quickly to changes in immediate surroundings. In response to cold sensors in the skin, a neural signal is sent to the hypothalamus, which then sends a signal to smooth muscle tissue surrounding blood vessels causing them to constrict and reduce blood flow. This reduces heat lost to the environment. The hypothalamus also sends signals to muscles to erect hairs and shiver and to endocrine glands like the thyroid to secrete hormones capable of ramping up metabolism. These actions increase heat conservation and stimulate its production in the body in response to cooling temperatures.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s02_s04_p03">When body temperature rises, as what occurs during exercise, the hypothalamus detects an increase in blood temperature. In response, the hypothalamus sends a signal to the smooth muscle of blood vessels causing them to dilate so that more blood flows to the body’s periphery. Once on the skin, extra heat exits the body via perspiration (sweat), which is 98 to 99 percent water. Water on the skin’s surface evaporates, a process that takes energy and results in the loss of heat, thereby cooling the body. Perspiration is a process that intertwines temperature homeostasis with fluid and electrolyte homeostasis.

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_p01">As you eat a bite of food, the salivary glands secrete saliva. As the food enters your stomach, gastric juice is secreted. As it enters the small intestine, pancreatic juice is secreted. Each of these fluids contains a great deal of water. How is that water replaced in these organs? What happens to the water now in the intestines? In a day there is an exchange of about 10 liters of water among the body’s organs. The osmoregulation of this exchange involves complex communication between the brain, kidneys, and endocrine system. A homeostatic goal for a cell, a tissue, an organ, and an entire organism is to balance water output with water input.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p02">There is some debate over the amount of water required to maintain health because there is no consistent scientific evidence proving that drinking a particular amount of water improves health or reduces the risk of disease. In fact, kidney-stone prevention seems to be the only premise for water-consumption recommendations. You may be surprised to find out that the commonly held belief that people need to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day isn’t an official recommendation and isn’t based on any scientific evidence! The amount of water/fluids a person should consume every day is actually variable and should be based on the climate a person lives in, as well as their age, physical activity level, and kidney function. No maximum for water intake has been set.</p>

The thirst mechanism is activated in response to changes in water volume in the blood, but is even more sensitive to changes in blood osmolality. Blood osmolality is primarily driven by the concentration of sodium cations. The urge to drink results from a complex interplay of hormones and neuronal responses that coordinate to increase water input and contribute toward fluid balance and composition in the body. The “thirst center” is contained within the hypothalamus, a portion of the brain that lies just above the brain stem. In older people the thirst mechanism is not as responsive and as we age there is a higher risk for dehydration. Thirst happens in the following sequence of physiological events:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Receptor proteins in the kidney, heart, and hypothalamus detect decreased fluid volume or increased sodium concentration in the blood.</li>
                <li>Hormonal and neural messages are relayed to the brain’s thirst center in the hypothalamus.</li>
                <li>The hypothalamus sends neural signals to higher sensory areas in the cortex of the brain, stimulating the conscious thought to drink.</li>
                <li>Fluids are consumed.</li>
                <li>Receptors in the mouth and stomach detect mechanical movements involved with fluid ingestion.</li>
                <li>Neural signals are sent to the brain and the thirst mechanism is shut off.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p02">The physiological control of thirst is the back-up mechanism to increase water input. Fluid intake is controlled primarily by conscious eating and drinking habits dependent on social and cultural influences. For example, you might have a habit of drinking a glass of orange juice and eating a bowl of cereal every morning before school or work. Most American adolescents have a daily habit of soft-drink consumption. Soft-drink consumption is influenced by demographics, access to soft drinks, social impacts, and personal behavior.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Regulation of Daily Water Output</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_p01">As stated, daily water output averages 2.5 liters. There are two types of outputs. The first type is <strong class="emphasis bold">insensible water loss</strong>, meaning we are unaware of it. The body loses about 400 milliliters of its daily water output through exhalation. Another 500 milliliters is lost through our skin. The second type of output is <strong class="emphasis bold">sensible water loss</strong>, meaning we are aware of it. Urine accounts for about 1,500 milliliters of water output, and feces account for roughly 100 milliliters of water output. Regulating urine output is a primary function of the kidneys, and involves communication with the brain and endocrine system.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Kidneys Detect Blood Volume</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s01_p01">The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist and located on either side of the spine just below the rib cage (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_f01">Figure 7.4 "Kidneys"</a>). The kidneys filter about 190 liters of blood and produce (on average) 1.5 liters of urine per day. Urine is mostly water, but it also contains electrolytes and waste products, such as urea. The amount of water filtered from the blood and excreted as urine is dependent on the amount of water in, and the electrolyte composition of, blood.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s01_p02">Kidneys have protein sensors that detect blood volume from the pressure, or stretch, in the blood vessels of the kidneys. When blood volume is low, kidney cells detect decreased pressure and secrete the enzyme, renin. Renin travels in the blood and cleaves another protein into the active hormone, angiotensin. Angiotensin targets three different organs (the adrenal glands, the hypothalamus, and the muscle tissue surrounding the arteries) to rapidly restore blood volume and, consequently, pressure.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s01_p03">First, angiotensin travels to the outer perimeter of the adrenal glands and stimulates release of the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone travels back to the kidneys and stimulates the sodium-potassium pump. As a result of the pump’s work, the blood reabsorbs the sodium from the liquid that has already been filtered by the kidneys. Water follows sodium into the blood by osmosis, resulting in less water in the urine and restored fluid balance and composition of blood.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s01_p04">Next, angiotensin travels to the hypothalamus where it stimulates the thirst mechanism and the release of antidiuretic hormone. Antidiuretic hormone travels back to the kidneys where it increases water reabsorption.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s01_p05">Lastly, angiotensin targets smooth muscle tissue surrounding arteries, causing them to contract (narrow) the blood vessels, which assists in elevating blood pressure.</p>

In response to a high sodium level, the hypothalamus activates the thirst mechanism and concurrently stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone. Thus, it is not only kidneys that stimulate antidiuretic- hormone release, but also the hypothalamus. This dual control of antidiuretic hormone release allows for the body to respond to both decreased blood volume and increased blood osmolality.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s03_p01">Cells in the adrenal glands sense when sodium levels are low, and when potassium levels are high, in the blood. In response to either stimulus, they release aldosterone. Therefore, aldosterone is released in response to angiotensin stimulation and is also controlled by blood electrolyte concentrations. In either case, aldosterone communicates the same message, which is to increase sodium reabsorption and consequently water reabsorption. In exchange, potassium is excreted.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s03_p02">The mechanisms involved in regulating water input and output are intertwined with those controlling electrolyte balance. In a healthy individual, this multilevel coordinated control of fluid and electrolyte levels in the body ensures homeostasis. However, in a person with heart failure, the crosstalk between organs can have dire consequences. Heart failure results in a decrease in blood output from the heart, which lowers blood pressure. In response to the lower blood pressure the kidneys release renin, leading to the release of antidiuretic hormone. Antidiuretic hormone acts on the kidneys and increases water reabsorption, thereby increasing blood volume and pressure. This makes the heart work harder and exacerbates the heart condition. To block this response, people with heart failure are treated with drugs that block the kidneys’ compensatory response. Diuretics are drugs that act either by inhibiting the actions of antidiuretic hormone or by promoting sodium excretion in the urine. This increases water output and blood pressure is reduced. Diuretics, along with other drugs, are useful in treating heart failure and in decreasing blood pressure in people with hypertension.</p>

The maintenance of the unequal volumes of water between fluid compartments is achieved by balancing the force of water (hydrostatic pressure) against the force of all dissolved substances. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Concentration</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of particles in a set volume of water.</span></span> means the amount of particles in a set volume of water. (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration of all dissolved substances is equal.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_p02">The force driving the water movement through the selectively permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">osmotic pressure</a><span class="glossdef">The force exerted by solutes at different concentrations on either side of a selectively permeable membrane.</span></span>. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an equal rate).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_p03">One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different volumes is the following</p>
    <span class="informalequation block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_eqx01"><span class="mathphrase">5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L = 5g/L)</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_p04">The differences in concentrations of particular substances provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work. A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water above a dam. When water falls through a dam the potential energy is changed to moving energy (kinetic), that in turn is captured by turbines. Similarly, when an electrolyte at higher concentration in the extracellular fluid is transported into a cell, the potential energy is harnessed and used to perform work.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_p05">Cells are constantly transporting nutrients in and wastes out. How is the concentration of solutes maintained if they are in a state of flux? This is where electrolytes come into play. The cell (or more specifically the numerous sodium-potassium pumps in its membrane) continuously pumps sodium ions out to establish a chemical gradient. The transport protein, called the glucose symporter, uses the sodium gradient to power glucose movement into the cell. Sodium and glucose both move into the cell. Water passively follows the sodium. To restore balance, the sodium-potassium pump transfers sodium back to the extracellular fluid and water follows (see <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_n02">Note 7.26 "Interactive 7.1"</a>). Every cycle of the sodium-potassium pump involves the movement of three sodium ions out of a cell, in exchange for two potassium ions into a cell. To maintain charge neutrality on the outside of cells every sodium cation is followed by a chloride anion. Every cycle of the pump costs one molecule of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The constant work of the sodium-potassium pump maintains the solute equilibrium and consequently, water distribution between intracellular and extracellular fluids.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_p06">The unequal movement of the positively charged sodium and potassium ions makes intracellular fluid more negatively charged than the extracellular fluid. This charge gradient is another source of energy that a cell uses to perform work. You will soon learn that this charge gradient and the sodium-potassium pump are also essential for nerve conduction and muscle contraction. The many functions of the sodium-potassium pump in the body account for approximately a quarter of total resting energy expenditure.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p01">Sodium, is vital not only for maintaining fluid balance but also for many other essential functions. In contrast to many minerals, sodium absorption in the small intestine is extremely efficient and in a healthy individual all excess sodium is excreted by the kidneys. In fact, very little sodium is required in the diet (about 200 milligrams) because the kidneys actively reabsorb sodium. Kidney reabsorption of sodium is hormonally controlled, allowing for a relatively constant sodium concentration in the blood.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Other Functions of Sodium in the Body</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p01">The second notable function of sodium is in nerve impulse transmission. Nerve impulse transmission results from the transport of sodium cations into a nerve cell, which creates a charge difference (or voltage) between the nerve cell and its extracellular environment. Similar to how a current moves along a wire, a sodium current moves along a nerve cell. Stimulating a muscle contraction also involves the movement of sodium ions as well as other ion movements. For a muscle to contract, a nerve impulse travels to a muscle. The movement of the sodium current in the nerve communicates to the muscle by releasing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Acetylcholine signals sodium channels in the muscle to open and sodium rushes in, creating another current that travels along the muscle eventually culminating in contraction. In both the nerve cell and the muscle cell, the sodium that went in during a stimulus now has to be moved out by the sodium-potassium pump.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p02">Sodium is essential for nutrient absorption in the small intestine and also for nutrient reabsorption in the kidney. Amino acids, glucose, and water must make their way from the small intestine to the blood. To do so they pass through intestinal cells on their way to the blood. The transport of nutrients through intestinal cells is facilitated by the sodium-potassium pump, which by moving sodium out of the cell, creates a higher sodium concentration outside of the cell (requiring ATP).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p01">Sweating is a homeostatic mechanism for maintaining body temperature, which influences fluid and electrolyte balance. Sweat is mostly water but also contains some electrolytes, mostly sodium and chloride. Under normal environmental conditions (i.e., not hot, humid days) water and sodium loss through sweat is negligible, but is highly variable among individuals. It is estimated that sixty minutes of high-intensity physical activity, like playing a game of tennis, can produce approximately one liter of sweat; however the amount of sweat produced is highly dependent on environmental conditions. A liter of sweat typically contains between 1 and 2 grams of sodium and therefore exercising for multiple hours can result in a high amount of sodium loss in some people. Additionally, hard labor can produce substantial sodium loss through sweat. In either case, the lost sodium is easily replaced in the next snack or meal.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p02">In athletes <strong class="emphasis bold">hyponatremia</strong>, or a low blood-sodium level, is not so much the result of excessive sodium loss in sweat, but rather drinking too much water. The excess water dilutes the sodium concentration in blood. Illnesses causing vomiting, sweating, and diarrhea may also cause hyponatremia. The symptoms of hyponatremia, also called water intoxication since it is often the root cause, include nausea, muscle cramps, confusion, dizziness, and in severe cases, coma and death. The physiological events that occur in water intoxication are the following:</p>

                <li>Excessive sodium loss and/or water intake.</li>

                <li>Water moves to where solutes are more concentrated (i.e. into cells).</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p03">Hyponatremia in endurance athletes (such as marathon runners) can be avoided by drinking the correct amount of water, which is about 1 cup every twenty minutes during the event. Sports drinks are better at restoring fluid and blood-glucose levels than replacing electrolytes. During an endurance event you would be better off drinking water and eating an energy bar that contains sugars, proteins, and electrolytes. The American College of Sports Medicine suggests if you are exercising for longer than one hour you eat one high carbohydrate (25–40 grams) per hour of exercise along with ample water.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_004">Convertino, V.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p01">The IOM has set an AI level for sodium for healthy adults between the ages of nineteen and fifty at 1.5 grams (1,500 milligrams). (See <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s03_t01">Table 7.2 "Dietary Reference Intakes for Sodium"</a>.) Table salt is approximately 40 percent sodium and 60 percent chloride. As a reference point, only ⅔ teaspoon of salt is needed in the diet to meet the AI for sodium. The AI takes into account the amount of sodium lost in sweat during recommended physical activity levels and additionally provides for the sufficient intake of other nutrients, such as chloride, meaning that to get all the other nutrients in our diet, we have to allow for a higher intake of sodium. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for sodium is 2.3 grams per day for adults. (Just over 1 teaspoon of salt contains the 2.3 grams of sodium recommended). The UL is considered appropriate for healthy individuals but not those with hypertension (high blood pressure). The IOM estimates that greater than 95 percent of men and 75 percent of women in America consume salt in excess of the UL. Many scientific studies demonstrate that reducing salt intake prevents hypertension, is helpful in reducing blood pressure after hypertension is diagnosed, and reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease. The IOM recommends that people over fifty, African Americans, diabetics, and those with chronic kidney disease should consume no more than 1.5 grams of sodium per day. The American Heart Association (AHA) states that all Americans, not just those listed, should consume less than 1.5 grams of sodium per day to prevent cardiovascular disease. The AHA recommends this because millions of people have risk factors for hypertension and there is scientific evidence supporting that lower-sodium diets are preventive against hypertension.</p>

Food additives are often high in sodium, for example, monosodium glutamate (MSG) contains 12 percent sodium. Additionally, baking soda, baking powder, disodium phosphate, sodium alginate, and sodium nitrate or nitrite contain a significant proportion of sodium. When you see a food’s Nutrition Facts label, you can check the ingredients list to identify the source of the added sodium. Various claims about the sodium content in foods must be in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s03_s02_t01">Table 7.4 "Food Packaging Claims Regarding Sodium"</a>).</p>

                    <p class="para" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s03_s02_p02">To decrease your sodium intake, become a salt-savvy shopper by reading the labels and ingredients lists of processed foods and choosing those lower in salt. Even better, stay away from processed foods and control the seasoning of your foods. Eating a diet with less salty foods diminishes salt cravings so you may need to try a lower sodium diet for a week or two before you will be satisfied with the less salty food.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Salt Substitutes</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s04_p01">For those with hypertension or those looking for a way to decrease salt use, using a salt substitute for food preparation is one option. However, many salt substitutes still contain sodium, just in lesser amounts than table salt. Also, remember that most salt in the diet is not from table-salt use, but from processed foods. Salt substitutes often replace the sodium with potassium. People with kidney disorders often have problems getting rid of excess potassium in the diet and are advised to avoid salt substitutes containing potassium. People with liver disorders should also avoid salt substitutes containing potassium because their treatment is often accompanied by potassium dysregulation. <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s04_t01">Table 7.5 "Salt Substitutes"</a> displays the sodium and potassium amounts in some salt substitutes.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s03_p01">Potassium is the most abundant positively charged ion inside of cells. Ninety percent of potassium exists in intracellular fluid, with about 10 percent in extracellular fluid, and only 1 percent in blood plasma. As with sodium, potassium levels in the blood are strictly regulated. The hormone aldosterone is what primarily controls potassium levels, but other hormones (such as insulin) also play a role. When potassium levels in the blood increase, the adrenal glands release aldosterone. The aldosterone acts on the collecting ducts of kidneys, where it stimulates an increase in the number of sodium-potassium pumps. Sodium is then reabsorbed and more potassium is excreted. Because potassium is required for maintaining sodium levels, and hence fluid balance, about 200 milligrams of potassium are lost from the body every day.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s04_s03_s01_p01">Nerve impulse involves not only sodium, but also potassium. A nerve impulse moves along a nerve via the movement of sodium ions into the cell. To end the impulse, potassium ions rush out of the nerve cell, thereby decreasing the positive charge inside the nerve cell. This diminishes the stimulus. To restore the original concentrations of ions between the intracellular and extracellular fluid, the sodium-potassium pump transfers sodium ions out in exchange for potassium ions in. On completion of the restored ion concentrations, a nerve cell is now ready to receive the next impulse. Similarly, in muscle cells potassium is involved in restoring the normal membrane potential and ending the muscle contraction. Potassium also is involved in protein synthesis, energy metabolism, and platelet function, and acts as a buffer in blood, playing a role in acid-base balance.</p>

The signs and symptoms of hypokalemia are related to the functions of potassium in nerve cells and consequently skeletal and smooth-muscle contraction. The signs and symptoms include muscle weakness and cramps, respiratory distress, and constipation. Severe potassium depletion can cause the heart to have abnormal contractions and can even be fatal. High levels of potassium in the blood, or <strong class="emphasis bold">hyperkalemia</strong>, also affects the heart. It is a silent condition as it often displays no signs or symptoms. Extremely high levels of potassium in the blood disrupt the electrical impulses that stimulate the heart and can cause the heart to stop. Hyperkalemia is usually the result of kidney dysfunction.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s05_p01">As with all nutrients, having too much or too little water has health consequences. Excessive water intake can dilute the levels of critical electrolytes in the blood. Water intoxication is rare, however when it does happen, it can be deadly. On the other hand, having too little water in the body is common. In fact, diarrhea-induced dehydration is the number-one cause of early-childhood death world-wide. In this section we will discuss subtle changes in electrolytes that compromise health on a chronic basis.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">High-Hydration Status: Water Intoxication/Hyponatremia</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s05_s01_p01">Water intoxication mainly affects athletes who overhydrate. Water intoxication is extremely rare, primarily because healthy kidneys are capable of excreting up to one liter of excess water per hour. Overhydration was unfortunately demonstrated in 2007 by Jennifer Strange, who drank six liters of water in three hours while competing in a “Hold Your Wee for a Wii” radio contest. Afterward she complained of a headache, vomited, and died.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Low-Hydration Status: Dehydration</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s05_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Dehydration</a><span class="glossdef">Water loss from the body without adequate replacement.</span></span> refers to water loss from the body without adequate replacement. It can result from either water loss or electrolyte imbalance, or, most commonly, both. Dehydration can be caused by prolonged physical activity without adequate water intake, heat exposure, excessive weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, blood loss, infectious diseases, malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and very high glucose levels. Physiologically, dehydration decreases blood volume. The water in cells moves into the blood to compensate for the low blood-volume, and cells shrink. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include thirst, dizziness, fainting, headaches, low blood-pressure, fatigue, low to no urine output, and, in extreme cases, loss of consciousness and death. Signs and symptoms are usually noticeable after about 2 percent of total body water is lost.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s05_s02_p02">Chronic dehydration is linked to higher incidences of some diseases. There is strong evidence that low-hydration status increases the risk for kidney stones and exercise-induced asthma. There is also some scientific evidence that chronic dehydration increases the risk for kidney disease, heart disease, and the development of hyperglycemia in people with diabetes. Older people often suffer from chronic dehydration as their thirst mechanism is no longer as sensitive as it used to be.</p>

        <div class="section" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s05_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Heat Stroke</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s05_s02_s01_p01">Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body temperature is greater than 105.1°F (40.6°C). It is the result of the body being unable to sufficiently cool itself by thermoregulatory mechanisms. Dehydration is a primary cause of heat stroke as there are not enough fluids in the body to maintain adequate sweat production, and cooling of the body is impaired. Signs and symptoms are dry skin (absence of sweating), dizziness, trouble breathing, rapid pulse, confusion, agitation, seizures, coma, and possibly death. Dehydration may be preceded by heat exhaustion, which is characterized by heavy sweating, rapid breathing, and fast pulse. The elderly, infants, and athletes are the most at risk for heat stroke.</p>

It is reported as the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure, which is the greatest and least pressure on an artery that occurs with each heart beat. The force of blood against an artery is measured with a device called a sphygmomanometer. The results are recorded in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. A desirable blood pressure ranges between 90/60 and 120/80 mmHg. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hypertension</a><span class="glossdef">The scientific term for high blood pressure and equivalent to a sustained blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or greater.</span></span> is the scientific term for high blood pressure and defined as a sustained blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or greater.

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s05_s02_s02_p02">There has been much debate about the role sodium plays in hypertension.

The DASH diet is an eating plan that is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat. Fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy foods, whole-grain foods, fish, poultry, and nuts are emphasized while red meats, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages are mostly avoided. (To find out more about the DASH eating plan see <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s05_s02_s02_n01">Note 7.37 "Interactive 7.3"</a>.) In this study, people on the low-sodium (1500 milligrams per day) DASH diet had mean systolic blood pressures that were 7.1 mmHg lower than people without hypertension not on the DASH diet.

A part of this act tasked the CDC, under guidance from the IOM, to make recommendations for Americans to reduce dietary sodium intake. This task is ongoing and involves “studying government approaches (regulatory and legislative actions), food supply approaches (new product development, food reformulation), and information/education strategies for the public and professionals.”<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_010">Jane E.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Salt Sensitivity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s05_s03_p01">High dietary intake of sodium is one risk factor for hypertension and contributes to high blood pressure in many people. However, studies have shown that not everyone’s blood pressure is affected by lowering sodium intake. About 10 to 20 percent of the population is considered to be salt-sensitive, meaning their blood pressure is affected by salt intake. Genetics, race, gender, weight, and physical activity level are determinants of salt sensitivity. African Americans, women, and overweight individuals are more salt-sensitive than others. Also, if hypertension runs in a person’s family, that person is more likely to be salt-sensitive. Because reducing dietary salt intake will not work for everyone with hypertension or a risk for developing the condition, there are many opponents of reducing dietary salt intake at the national level. Among such opponents is the Salt Institute, a nonprofit trade organization that states, “No evidence demonstrates that current salt intake levels lead to worse health outcomes such as more heart attacks or higher cardiovascular mortality.”<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_011">The Salt Institute. “Salt and Health.” © 2011 Salt Institute.

In 1974, the US federal government enacted The Safe Drinking Water Act with the intention of providing the American public with safe drinking water. This act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set water-quality standards and assure that the 150,000-plus public water systems in the country adhere to the standards. About 15 percent of Americans obtain drinking water from private wells, which are not subject to EPA standards.</p>

Chlorination is cheap and effective at killing bacteria. However, it is less effective at removing protozoa, such as <em class="emphasis">Giardia lamblia</em>. Chlorine-resistant protozoa and viruses are instead removed by extensive filtration methods. In the decades immediately following the implementation of water chlorination and disinfection methods in this country, water-borne illnesses, such as cholera and typhoid fever, essentially disappeared in the United States (<a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_f01">Figure 7.9</a>).

Some of these chlorinated compounds, when present at extremely high levels, have been shown to cause cancer in studies conducted in rodents. In addition to many other contaminants, the EPA has set maximum contaminant levels (legal threshold limits) for these chlorinated compounds in water, in order to guard against disease risk. The oversight of public water systems in this country is not perfect and water-borne illnesses are significantly underreported; however, there are far fewer cases of water-borne illnesses than those attributed to food-borne illnesses that have occurred in the recent past.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_s01_p01">The characteristics of hard water are attributed to higher concentration of calcium and magnesium salts. Hard water is prevalent in the mountain and central time zones and in the Midwestern United States. Hard water is characterized by a calcium carbonate concentration of at least 60 milligrams per liter. Higher concentrations of cations in hard water make it difficult to get soap to lather and clean effectively. Also, the cations precipitate as salts in pipes, dishes, and industrial equipment and can reduce the palatability of drinking water. The average dietary contribution of calcium and magnesium from water ranges between 5 and 20 percent.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_015">World Health Organization. “Hardness in Drinking Water.” © 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf">http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf</a></span> The World Health Organization states that there is no convincing evidence that consumption of hard water adversely affects human health.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_016">World Health Organization. “Hardness in Drinking Water.” © 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf">http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf</a></span> On the contrary, there is some evidence from observational studies that consuming hard water is inversely associated with the incidence of some chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and some cancers, although the studies have not been consistent and often have multiple confounding variables.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_s01_p02">Soft water is produced primarily by running water through a resin system which exchanges sodium cations for calcium and magnesium ions. Treating exceptionally hard waters can significantly increase the sodium concentration in drinking water. The practical benefits of soft water are that soap scum no longer makes dishes and bathrooms dingy, clothes are softer, and there is less of a toll on household and industrial equipment. On the other hand, the increased sodium in soft water can make it taste worse and potentially exacerbate health problems such as hypertension, especially in salt-sensitive populations. Soft water can be treated by a process called “reverse osmosis,” which removes the sodium ions. These filtration systems can be purchased for home use, although their cost is a bit high.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Is Bottled Water a Better Beverage Choice than Tap Water?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_s02_p01">Bottled water is not regulated by the EPA but by FDA. For bottled water, the FDA adheres to the same quality standards as those set by the EPA for tap water. Therefore, the contaminant levels set by the EPA for tap water are not different for bottled water; although there is much less testing, monitoring, and oversight of bottled water in comparison to tap water. Similar to tap water the source and treatment of bottled water determines its taste and quality. Depending on where you live, tap water can be a dietary source of minerals (such as calcium and magnesium), but remember that food rather than water serves as a more prominent dietary source of these minerals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_s02_p02">Distilled and purified bottled waters have had all minerals removed during processing, but not all bottled waters have had minerals removed. Mineral waters, sparkling waters, and Artesian waters are examples of bottled waters that contain some minerals, but they are more expensive. Tap water in the United States costs, on average, much less than one cent per gallon, while bottled water is upwards of three dollars per gallon. Moreover, bottled water uses more resources and produces more waste in comparison to tap water. Iowa State University reports that in the United States alone, the making of plastic bottles for bottled water consumption uses more than 1.5 million barrels of oil every year, which is more than the fuel required for one hundred thousand cars.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_017">Iowa State University. “Bottled Water, Know the Facts.” Accessed October 2, 2011. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.extension.iastate.edu/publications/pm1813.pdf">http://www.extension.iastate.edu/publications/pm1813.pdf</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_s02_s01_p01">Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical added to plastics, mostly polycarbonate (which is used to make bottled water containers), and to epoxy resins (which are used to line metal-based containers, such as those used for packaging infant formulas). It has been utilized for these purposes and many others since the 1940s. Most studies evaluating toxicity of BPA demonstrate it does not cause adverse health effects to humans at the levels it exists in for beverage and food containers. However, in January of 2010 the FDA issued an update on BPA uses in the food industry.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_018">US Food and Drug Administration. “Update on Bisphenol A (BPA) for Use in Food Contact Applications.” Last updated March 30, 2012. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm197739.htm">http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm197739.htm</a>.</span> This update reports that the FDA, along with the IOM and the National Toxicology Program, “have some concern about the potential effects of BPA on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and young children.”<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_019">US Food and Drug Administration. “Update on Bisphenol A (BPA) for Use in Food Contact Applications.” Last updated March 30, 2012.</span> To address these potential health concerns studies are currently being conducted to further evaluate the risk of adverse health effects associated with exposure to low levels of BPA. In the interim the FDA is taking steps to reduce human exposure to BPA. Many bottled water companies have switched to “BPA-free” plastic containers.</p>

                        <li>In all age groups the consumption of total beverages provides, on average, 21 percent of daily caloric intake. This is 7 percent higher than the IOM acceptable caloric intake from beverages, and 11 percent higher than that recommended by The Beverage Panel.</li>
                        <li>In 1974, the US federal government enacted The Safe Drinking Water Act in order to help provide the American public with safe drinking water.</li>
                        <li>In the decades immediately following the implementation of water chlorination and disinfection methods, water-borne illnesses, such as cholera and typhoid fever, essentially disappeared in the United States. In fact, the treatment of drinking water is touted as one of the top public-health achievements of the last century.</li>
                        <li>There is some evidence from observational studies that consuming hard water is inversely associated with the incidence of some chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and some cancers.</li>
                        <li>Bottled water is not regulated by the EPA but by the FDA. The contaminant levels set by the EPA for tap water are not different for bottled water, but there is much less testing, monitoring, and oversight of bottled water in comparison to tap water.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_p01">Alcohol is both a beverage providing some sustenance and a drug. For thousands of years, alcohol has been consumed in a medicinal, celebratory, and ritualistic manner. It is drunk in just about every country and often in excessive amounts. Alcohol is a psychoactive drug. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">psychoactive drug</a><span class="glossdef">Any substance that crosses the blood-brain barrier and affects the brain’s functioning.</span></span> is any substance that crosses the blood-brain barrier primarily affecting the functioning of the brain, be it altering mood, thinking, memory, motor control, or behavior. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Alcohols</a><span class="glossdef">In chemistry, alcohols refer to a group of similar organic compounds, but in beverages the only alcohol consumed is ethanol.</span></span> in chemistry refer to a group of similar organic compounds, but in beverages the only alcohol consumed is ethanol.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_p03">More than 90 percent of ingested alcohol is metabolized in the liver. The remaining amount stays in the blood and is eventually excreted through the breath (which is how Breathalyzers work), urine, saliva, and sweat. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">blood alcohol concentration (BAC)</a><span class="glossdef">A measurement of the level of alcohol in the blood stream, in terms of percentages; used to determine if an individual is legally intoxicated and driving while impaired.</span></span> is measured in milligrams percent, comparing units of alcohol to units of blood. BAC is a measurement used legally to assess intoxication and the impairment and ability to perform certain activities, as in driving a car. As a general rule, the liver can metabolize one standard drink (defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ½ ounces of hard liquor) per hour. Drinking more than this, or more quickly, will cause BAC to rise to potentially unsafe levels. <a class="xref" href="#zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_t01">Table 7.12 "Mental and Physical Effects of Different BAC Levels"</a> summarizes the mental and physical effects associated with different BAC levels.</p>

Drinking coffee or taking a shower will not help. The legal limit for intoxication is a BAC of 0.08. Taking into account the rate at which the liver metabolizes alcohol after drinking stops, and the alcohol excretion rate, it takes at least five hours for a legally intoxicated person to achieve sobriety.</p>

The drop in risk for these adverse events ranges between percent. Moreover, there is some scientific evidence that moderate alcohol intake reduces the risk for metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, and gallstones. In addition to providing some health benefits, moderate alcohol intake has long served as a digestive aid and a source of comfort and relaxation, and it induces social interaction, thereby benefiting all aspects of the health triangle. It has not been clearly demonstrated that moderate alcohol consumption benefits younger populations, and the risks of any alcohol consumption do not outweigh the benefits for pregnant women, those who are taking medications that interact with alcohol, and those who are unable to drink in moderation.</p>

A typical beer is 150 kilocalories, a glass of wine contains approximately 80 kilocalories, and an ounce of hard liquor (without mixer) is around 65 kilocalories. Alcoholic drinks in excess contribute to weight gain by substantially increasing caloric intake. However, alcohol displays its two-faced character again in its effects on body weight, making many scientific studies contradictory. Multiple studies show high intakes of hard liquor are linked to weight gain, although this may be the result of the regular consumption of hard liquor with sugary soft drinks, juices, and other mixers. On the other hand drinking beer and, even more so, red wine, is not consistently linked to weight gain and in some studies actually decreases weight gain. The contradictory results of scientific studies that have examined the association of alcohol intake with body weight are partly due to the fact that alcohol contributes calories to the diet, but when drunk in excess reduces the secretion of pancreatic juice and damages the lining of the gastrointestinal system, impairing nutrient digestion and absorption. The impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients in alcoholics contributes to their characteristic “skinniness” and multiple associated micronutrient deficiencies. The most common macronutrient deficiency among alcoholics is water, as it is excreted in excess. Commonly associated micronutrient deficiencies include thiamine, pyridoxine, folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium, and zinc. Furthermore, alcoholics typically replace calories from alcohol with those of nutritious foods, sometimes getting 50 percent or more of their daily caloric intake from alcoholic beverages.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_s02_s01_p01">Alcohol can adversely affect nearly every area of the brain. When BAC rises, the central nervous system is depressed. Alcohol disrupts the way nerve cells communicate with each other by interfering with receptors on certain cells. The immediate impact of alcohol on the brain can be seen in the awkwardly displayed symptoms of confusion, blurred vision, slurred speech, and other signs of intoxication. These symptoms will go away once drinking stops, but abusive alcohol consumption over time can lead to long-lasting damage to the brain and nervous system. This is because alcohol and its metabolic byproducts kill brain cells. Excessive alcohol intake has the following effects on specific areas of the brain:</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_s02_s02_p01">According to the CDC, 14,406 Americans died from alcohol-related liver diseases in 2007. Although not every alcoholic or heavy drinker will die from liver problems, the liver is one of the body’s main filtering organs and is severely stressed by alcohol abuse. The term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD)</a><span class="glossdef">Liver problems linked to excessive alcohol intake including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis.</span></span> is used to describe liver problems linked to excessive alcohol intake. ALD can be progressive, with individuals first suffering from a fatty liver and going on to develop cirrhosis. It is also possible to have different forms of ALD at the same time.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_s02_s02_p02">The three most common forms of ALD are:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_s02_s02_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Fatty liver.</strong> A rather benign disorder that develops after excessive alcohol consumption; however it can progress to more fatal diseases. Fatty liver is reversible if alcohol use is brought under control.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Alcoholic hepatitis.</strong> The symptoms of this alcohol-induced liver inflammation are a swollen liver, abdominal pain, nausea, fever, jaundice, and vomiting. Although linked to alcohol use, even people who drink moderately can sometimes develop this condition, and not all alcohol abusers do. If a person stops drinking alcohol, the liver damage can be reversed. But if they continue, cirrhosis may develop and death can result.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cirrhosis.</strong> This serious and sometimes fatal form of ALD develops when liver cells die and form scar tissue, which blocks blood flow and causes wastes and toxins to build up in the system. Strictly speaking, cirrhosis cannot be cured. It can, however, be stopped with medical treatment and complications can be managed if the individual stops drinking, and many do survive. Not all cases of cirrhosis are strictly due to alcoholism, and not all alcoholics develop the disease. Symptoms of cirrhosis include the buildup of abdominal fluid (ascites), abdominal pain, fever, thirst, confusion, and fatigue.</li>

It is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance and is such an important part of many people’s lives that they might not even think of it as a drug. Up to 90 percent of adults around the world use it on a daily basis. According to both the FDA and the American Medical Association the moderate use of caffeine is “generally recognized as safe.” It is considered a legal psychoactive drug and, for the most part, is completely unregulated.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s02_s01_p02">The average caffeine consumption for American adults is considered moderate at 280 milligrams per day, although it is not uncommon for people to consume up to 600 milligrams per day. This works out to almost 4 ½ cups of coffee per day. The bitter taste of caffeine is palatable for many and coffee is the most readily available source of it, accounting for 70 percent of daily caffeine consumption. The second readily available source of caffeine is soft drinks, delivering 16 percent of daily caffeine. (In this case, the bitter caffeine taste is usually masked by a large amount of added sugar.) Tea is the third common source of caffeine, at 12 percent.</p>

Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in our brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific protein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects the levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase in energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the brain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep. At high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and interferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as shakiness, anxiety, and insomnia. People’s sensitivity to the adverse effects of caffeine varies and some people develop side effects at much lower doses. The many effects caffeine has on the brain do not diminish with habitual drinking of caffeinated beverages.</p>

There is a lesser amount of evidence suggesting increased coffee consumption lowers the risk of heart attacks in both men and women, and strokes in women. In smaller population studies, decaffeinated coffee sometimes performs as well as caffeinated coffee, bringing up the hypothesis that there are beneficial chemicals in coffee other than caffeine that play larger roles in the health benefits of coffee.

A comprehensive review published in the <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> reports that caffeine induces a modest increase in blood pressure lasting less than three hours in people with hypertension, but there is no evidence that habitual coffee consumption increases blood pressure long-term or increases the risk for cardiovascular disease.<span class="footnote" id="zimmerman_1.0-fn07_028">Mesas, A. E. et al. “The Effect of Coffee on Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular Disease in Hypertensive Individuals: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.” <em class="emphasis">Am J Clin Nutr</em> 94, no. 4 (2011): 1113–26. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880846">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880846</a>.</span> There is no good evidence that chronic caffeine exposure increases blood pressure chronically in people without hypertension.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s02_s03_p02">Some have hypothesized that caffeine elevates calcium excretion and therefore could potentially harm bones. The scientific consensus at this time is that caffeine minimally affects calcium levels and intake is not associated with any increased risk for osteoporosis or the incidence of fractures in most women. Although the effect of caffeine on calcium excretion is small, postmenopausal women with risk factors for osteoporosis may want to make sure their dietary caffeine intake is low or moderate and not excessive.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">The Caffeine Myth</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s02_s03_s01_p01">A diuretic refers to any substance that elevates the normal urine output above that of drinking water. Caffeinated beverages are commonly believed to be dehydrating due to their diuretic effect, but results from scientific studies do not support that caffeinated beverages increase urine output more so than water. This does not mean that consuming caffeinated beverages does not affect urine output, but rather that it does not increase urine output more than water does. Thus, caffeinated beverages are considered a source of hydration similar to water.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Sports Drinks</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s03_p01">Scientific studies under certain circumstances show that consuming sports drinks (instead of plain water) during high-intensity exercise lasting longer than one hour significantly enhances endurance, and some evidence indicates it additionally enhances performance. There is no consistent evidence that drinking sports drinks instead of plain water enhances endurance or performance in individuals exercising less than one hour and at low to moderate intensities. A well-concocted sports drink contains sugar, water, and sodium in the correct proportions so that hydration is optimized. The sugar is helpful in maintaining blood-glucose levels needed to fuel muscles, the water keeps an athlete hydrated, and the sodium enhances fluid absorption and replaces some of that lost in sweat. The American College of Sports Medicine states that the goal of drinking fluids during exercise is to prevent dehydration, which compromises performance and endurance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s03_p02">The primary source of water loss during intense physical activity is sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many factors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and type of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal endurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over-hydrate. A person’s sweating rate can be approximated by measuring weight before and after exercise—the difference in weight will be the amount of water weight you lost.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s03_p03">The primary electrolyte lost in sweat is sodium. One liter of sweat can contain between 1,000–2,000 milligrams of sodium. Potassium, magnesium, and calcium are also lost, but in much lower amounts. If you are exercising at high intensity for greater than ninety minutes, it is important to replace sodium as well as water. This can be partly accomplished by consuming a sports drink. The highest content of sodium in commercial sports drinks is approximately 450 milligrams per liter and thus will not replace all lost sodium unless a person drinks several liters. This is NOT recommended, as water intoxication not only compromises performance, but may also be deadly. The sodium in sports drinks enhances fluid absorption so that rehydration is more efficiently accomplished. If you are not exercising for more than ninety minutes at a high intensity, dietary intake of sodium and other electrolytes should be sufficient for replacing lost electrolytes.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Who Needs Sports Drinks?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s03_s01_p01">Children and adult athletes exercising for more than one hour at high-intensity (tennis, rowing, rugby, soccer, etc.) may benefit endurance-wise and possibly performance-wise from consuming a sports drink rather than water. However, consuming sports drinks provides no benefit over water to endurance, performance, or exercise recovery for those exercising less than an hour. In fact, as with all other sugary drinks containing few to no nutrients, they are only another source of calories. Drinking sports drinks when you are doing no exercise at all is not recommended.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s03_s02_p01">Instead of a sports drink, you can replenish lost fluids and obtain energy and electrolytes during exercise by drinking plain water and eating a sports bar or snack that contains carbohydrates, protein, and electrolytes. Postexercise, low-fat milk has been scientifically shown to be just as effective as a sports drink as a rehydration beverage and it is more nutrient-dense, containing carbohydrates, protein, and electrolytes, in addition to other vitamins.</p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="zimmerman_1.0-ch07_s07_s03_s02_l01">
                    <li>Alcohol in excess is detrimental to health; in moderation, however, it is promoted as a benefit to the body and mind. The US <em class="emphasis">Dietary Guidelines</em> define moderate alcohol intake as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men.</li>
                    <li>Moderate intake of alcohol has been shown in multiple scientific studies to provide health benefits, including reducing the risks of heart disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, and gallstones.</li>
                    <li>The most renowned effects of caffeine on the body are increased alertness and delay of fatigue and sleep. At high doses, caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and interferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as shakiness, anxiety, and insomnia.</li>
                    <li>There is a good amount of scientific evidence supporting that higher consumption of caffeine, mostly in the form of coffee, substantially reduces the risk for developing Type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. There is a lesser amount of evidence suggesting increased coffee consumption lowers the risk of heart attacks in both men and women and strokes in women. According to both the FDA and the American Medical Association, the moderate use of caffeine is “generally recognized as safe.”</li>
                    <li>For most physically active individuals, water is the best hydration source. For endurance athletes, there is increased need of glucose as well as fluid. The body needs healthy foods and beverages, not supplements, to regain electrolytes lost through sweat.</li>
